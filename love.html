<h1>There Ain Mofo Nothing Wrong With Going Out On Dates With People</h1>
<p>There's supposed to be something magical about meeting a bish like you're supposed to see a random cutie pop up on Facebook and you send her a message and she sends you an emoji and fourteen comments later you are in love.
</p>
<p>Tinder. Nigga Tinder ain got shit da fuck to do with love. Shows you something about Humans Tinder does. Like it used to be in the Victorian era there was a grand tapestry of events that went into courtship between a man and a woman it was as epic as human society could come up with courtship it was the center of society. Now we just mofo swipe right. Our ceremony of courtship has been reduced to the swiping of a thumb of a consumer electronics good.
</p>
<p>Now we can just order pussy like pizza. Remember when you needed shit like rings and flowers to impress a woman. Remember when we used to go to restaurants together. Remember when dating was more than mofo developing fishing lures for social media dating sites. Like I can't just fish for bitches on Facebook. I can fish for bitches on OKCupid. When you just testing lures out you know it's fucked up. When you tell yourself you should specialize in setting up OKCupid profiles for people to increase their incoming fish by 400% total beesheet but whatever, just so long as they know they getting 400% more of the nothing they were getting before.
</p>
<p>I'm just saying. We're better than this. We have this thing called church if we could just get them to stop brainwashing us like it fucked up when like IN CHURCH in 2016 it BREAKING THEOLOGICAL NEWS that Jesus ain coming back. Like it's a breakthrough in religious consciousness to declare Jesus Christ dead and buried.
</p>
<p>Do you see what I am saying? It's 2016 you can order pussy like domino's on your computer fuck it you can order pussy AND domino's in like the span of 15 minutes. There is no magic to this. I need some magic and complexity. Like if you had to solve a puzzle to guess a girl's favorite color on social networking dating sites. Like when i'm fucking developing fucking fishing lures instead of putting myself out there being a man.
</p>
<p>Like I just have a problem with this thing at the center of our society when the center of our society should be the club. We should all belong to something and belonging to a dating website does not prepare you for dating. It prepares you for nothing. Being social prepares you for marriage. Not doing what I am doing holed up in a one bedroom apartment sending tweets to the White House on a lark an aid of an aid might send a message to someone that will send a message to someone. We need more concreteness in our social media.
</p>
<p>If people knew that if they sent a message to someone on a dating site they were going to get a date. They would do it differently they would be more discerning. Like there is nothing wrong with going on dates with 25 different guys over the span of 3 months because of social media or going out with 25 girls if it was casually kept to dating if it was a legit dating site you could get a date TONIGHT with a dating site.
</p>
<p>It's not a dating site it's a you me let's go get married site. This is bogus. Now there are couples that have these romantic stories of how they met through social media sites like OKCupid or Plenty of Fish and their story they tell their kids about how they met involves clicking buttons on a GUI interface not about how she was walking across the street and you waited for her to cross and you asked her for a cigarette and she gave you one and then you asked her for her phone number and she gave it to you and that night you called her and you had a four hour conversation with your future wife that you met that afternoon because you took the time to look her in the eye as she was on the other side of the street and she saw you waiting for her and she fell in love with you.
</p>
<p>Love.
</p>
<p>Things like that.
</p>
<p>Just nothing.
