<h1><p>Dear Enquirer,</p></h1>

<p>
  Chris Collinsworth has lost the plot. The NFL isn't supposed to be about stats, it's supposed to be about how you feel about it. It's supposed to be about how loud the crowd cheers, it's supposed to be about the personalities of the players, it's supposed to be about how much fun it is to play sports, da fuck stats got to do with anything?</p>

<p>It's something you do on sundays and go back to your life for the rest of the week. It's church for people that don't have time for jesus.</p>
<p>
  What the fuck do sports have to do with stats?</p>

<p>The answer is nothing.<br>
  <br>
  The question is why wouldn't chris collinsworth know that?</p>
