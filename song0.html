<h1>I Didn't Think I Would Find Rome</h1>

<p>Verse</p>

<p>And I sang the song of where I was from<br>
I sang the notes that chose my throat<br>
I took the stage that they gave to me<br>
If the world could only see what I see<br>
Now the whole world knows I love to sing<br>
What they don't know doesn't change a thing<br>
I grew up near a rusty sandwich shop<br>
I had other plans but my business flopped<br>
I couldn't help it I just had to leave<br>
I had a sound and this city wouldn't let me breathe<br>
So I packed my bags and headed off<br>
And left behind the life of a future boss<br>
I showed up in the city that never sleeps<br>
I didn't know what it felt like to be obsolete<br>
I rode in on a stallion that was made of light<br>
I dove into a culture that was an eternal fight<br>
</p>

<p>
Chorus
</p>

<p>
I drove to town before I found my sound<br>
Found my sound and then I found the city<br>
Found the city then I found the stage<br>
Found the stage then I found my purpose<br>
</p>

<p>
Verse
</p>

<p>
It was late one night and the club was packed<br>
I was breaking some bread with some people that didn't know jack<br>
She bought me a beer and I bought her a drink<br>
She had some moves on her that made it hard to think<br>
We went to the corner so that we could be alone<br>
Then she pulled out her number and now I had a new phone<br>
Smart phone smart guy smart move smart life<br>
We were in the corner and she was in the mood to moan<br>
The lights were lazers the the club was sound<br>
The men were an army and the women wore them downtown<br>
This was the life the songs I sang were for<br>
This was the life I was didn't ever want to ignore<br>
I didn't have the words to describe her tongue<br>
I just know it tasted like the night was young<br>
We had all night to feel the vibe<br>
Not sure what else to say, it was another night ride<br>
</p>

<p>
Chorus
</p>

<p>
I drove to town before I found my sound<br>
Found my sound and then I found the city<br>
Found the city then I found the stage<br>
Found the stage then I found my purpose<br>
</p>

<p>
Bridge
</p>

<p>
When I released my glow<br>
When I produced the show<br>
When I flipped the switch<br>
When I fixed the glitch<br>
</p>

<p>
Chorus
</p>

<p>
Centerstage where the world was mine<br>
I cleaned it's soul I reminded it it was divine<br>
I reached down deep and I pulled a sound<br>
From me to them it was when I became unwound<br>
The tickets sold the world was gold<br>
The oyster was closed around the pearl that was me<br>
I was the song of songs for the entire city<br>
It was time to shine shade grade fifty<br>
When the world got lost and I found the sound<br>
When I emanated the aura of epiphanies<br>
And reminded myself that I was earning my place in the city<br>
When I challenged the rules of antiquity<br>
The world challenged me to stand firm<br>
It was my voice that opened my world<br>
From so far away I found home<br>
I never thought I would find Rome.<br>
