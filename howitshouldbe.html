<h1>How It Should Be</h1>

<p>
We should put the internet at the center of society. Our leaders should be religious figures. We religious spend time sending tweets to the people that want us to. If you want a place of worship it would be no more than a phpBB site. If you want to organize a following you should use Buddy Press. If you want to get people involved in a football game you should be using Facebook to send messages to your wall letting people know you want to meet in the field the next day it's muddy and raining.
</p>
<p>
This football season and I don't think I can survive this life if I never play another football game ya'll. I don't think I can have access to all these people and have no one listening to me. It's one thing to be lonely when you alone in your apartment. It another thing to be lonely when you looking at like 5000 people every day in your apartment. Like I need to Skype with someone. I need to write with someone. I need to fly a kite with someone. I need to spend the night with someone.
</p>
<p>
Stay awake all night just talking about life looking for someone to spend all night with ya'll. Just talking about life with. Not sure what you pay your city's whores for but I know this one bitch that party for $40 on BackPage. I'm vexing myself to do it but ima about to spend my first money on a whore. Just someone that can come over and mofo spend time with me. Like I'm at that point ya'll. 
</p>
<p>
Like growing up and for a long time I used to have no problem meeting anyone. It been a long time since someone been to my apartment. I just need to spend some time with someone. Like a therapist. Like all we gonna do is talk. Just a whore and myself alone in my apartment just talking til dawn. She can leave when she wants to if she get's another call but I just need someone to talk to.
</p>
<p>
I ain the first john that just wanted to talk. Like here's your $40 now just sit on that couch and do your therapist. No I really don't want to stick my dick in your mouth. No I really ain trying to have kids right now. Alright maybe you can rub my shoulders. Alright maybe you can rub my feet. Alright maybe we can make out. I just need to remember what it used to be like.
</p>
<p>
It's been about three months since I made out with someoen. Really made out. Like she had me laid out on the futon and she was just loving me with her mouth. She loved my whole body. Like I don't know what it is about me. I vaguely wish there was something different about me. There ain too much to do if I ignore my body's needs. Like I got some money coming in but my body want more. So I behave in a way that leads to me having more money. Almost at the point where I start turning my money into cash. Like money and cash two diffferent things. You can have money on you all day but you might not have cash. You can have cash on you all day but you might not have money. See money hard to make it's like inventing something new a new way of doing things like you thinking about how you can get some cash well if you want cash you gotta trade something for it. 
</p>
<p>
I want some cash so I gotta trade something for it. I want to go into the bagel business. I'm thinking how can I differentiate myself in the market. I take the idea of the bagel and BOW! loaves of bagel bread. Cubes of Bagel. The Bagel Cube. That's money. Ain no one working with a cube of bagel. Now I got the money. The Bagel Cube. So now I get the equipment and start generating cubes of bagels and when I trade the cubes of bagels for cash. I got cash now. You can't really get cash without money. Like you can't. Not if you want an infinite supply of cash. 
</p>
<p>
If you want an infinite supply of cash you need money. Money comes from years of thought provocting conversation and delving into the recesses of the human mind. Money an idea. Some people ain got ideas. So they deal strictly with cash. Tried and true things. Money looks for shit that ain been done before to do as opposed to doing shit that been done before. If you into tried and true businesses like buying franchises or something you ain got no money. The man selling the franchise got money the man buying the franchise got cash. I'm more impressed with the people that have money. Squirrely people that may be right around your neighborhood. A lot of people you know got enough money they ain gotta do much. All their questions answered. 
</p>
<p>
If you want to explore cash you may be on an endless paper chase. You may have a dick in your pocket a fat dick of cash but like it how you got it that dick that define who you are. There are a lot of ways to get cash. You need money to get cash out of thin air. Like if you want cash you gotta start with your apartment and you gotta make candy of some original recipe. Like chocolate covered sugar cubes or paw paw nuget covered in chocalate. Money about doing something original. Not a spin just an evolution of the math. Not just an evolution of the math more like nigga you evolved the math.
</p>
<p>
Like there a lot of talk of people wanting to make more money. If you want to make more money you have to basically do a lot of reading. If you want more cash you have to make a lot of trades. You can set up your situation so that people come to you for the trade to make cash with or you can go to the people. You can be a door to door salesman or you can set up a retail shop and have people come to you to make your trades. Cash about trades. Money about ideas.
