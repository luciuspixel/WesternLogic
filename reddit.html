<h1>Reddit</h1>


<p>Aaron Swartz was a co founder of Reddit and he was also a proponent of a Free internet. Like so many things that get inherited by people that did not develop them they are worsened. Aaron Swartz was dangerous because he was in favor of freedom of thought. He was in favor of a stratafied society where the intellectuals of society outrank well the non intellectuals. He was in favor of the people that had the IQ's required to make good decisions to make the decisions that would frame society.
</p>
<p>Reddit was a product of Aaron Swartz's genius and it is no longer a product of Aaron Swartz's genius. Aaron Swartz based on his ideas and thoughts would be very upset with the modern state of Reddit. He would have been against the profound and intense set of rules on Ask Reddit and he would have allowed for their to be an open forum of questions on the very most essential element of Reddit which is Ask Reddit.
</p>
<p>
Reddit has degraded it is no longer Reddit the way glocks are no longer guns. Reddit is a work of travesty in progress. In a world with Facebook a superior website to Facebook is not to be accepted. Facebook is to be the gold standard of websites. To posit that Reddit is the gold standard of the Internet is Blasphemous in the modern media society.
</p>

<p>Where Reddit has in the past developed brain childs such as Reddit Univerity and Reddit Island and Reddit Magazine; these are the dreams of Aaron Swartz. Reddit University is a dream of Aaron Swartz it is an extension of his brainchild where people of high IQ are to be easily placed in positions of Education. Reddit Univeristy was a bright point and highlight of Reddit and it is now defunct. Reddit is now defunct. It has been squared away on the internet and has been brushed to the side of Facebook the brainchild of Mark Zuckerberg.
</p>

<p>Of the two Aaron Swartz was the superior thinker than Mark Zuckerberg. Where Mark Zuckerberg is billed as a Genius Aaron Swartz was a genius. Aaron Swartz would have been proud of Reddit Magazine and Reddit Island and would have enjoyed the future work of the now unthought of Reddit Films and Reddit Television and Reddit Radio and Reddit Advertising.
</p>

<p>Reddit is a Brain child. It is intended to be the Golden Standard of the Internet because it was developed by the Gold Standard Thought Pioneers of the Internet. The corporate proletariat invested heavily in Facebook and the Ivy League developed Facebook and how dare someone come along and be more intelligent than the Ivy League.
</p>

<p>Reddit is supposed to be a place of free speech where if you wish to promote your website, your business, your thoughts, your dreams, your self, your band, your album, your book, your magazine, your work you are to be permitted to do so. In privatizing Reddit with Conde Nast, Conde Nast has proceeded to lock down Reddit especially Ask Reddit where they edit the style of question you can ask because a good question can topple an empire repeatedly. A question such as Why Did Conde Nast Destroy Reddit? is not askable on Reddit.
</p>

<p>Most of you have no idea of how Reddit used to be. I do. I remember when Reddit was a place where you could explore the internet. Before reddit discovering the internet was more difficult. It was difficult to explore the internet because you had to hunt and peck for websites there was to my knowledge no popular culture website where you could find links to branch out and really explore the internet and where I was exploring We're Here and Albino Black Sheep and Truth and Beauty Bombs and random websites that would appear from typing in search terms in a website it was a boon to the internet to have a place where you could spend your time and share your side of the internet with everyone else that was sharing their side of the internet.
</p>

<p>Reddit has gotten worse. It has become innocuous. It has become redundant. It has become less a bastion of free speech and less of a place to start when one is exploring the internet. Aaron Swartz was distraught with working for Conde Nast because Conde Nast was more interested in controlling Reddit than Freeing it. Reddit is supposed to be the Gold Standard of the Internet. It is supposed to be the place that makes Facebook look retarded.
</p>

<p>Aaron Swartz was a genius. He was born a genius. He was built a genius. He had genius DNA. He helped solidify Reddit by putting his genius behind it. With the suicide of Aaron Swartz came the loss of his ethos. In the loss of Aaron Swartz the replacement to Aaron Swartz was not a brave pioneering genius the replacement to Aaron Swartz was a cowering frightened fool that took to dismantling a work of genius and making it useless.
</p>
<p>What Reddit is supposed to shine for is Freedom of Speech and it is to aid the ability to explore the internet. Reddit has no problem with promoting someone else's work but how dare you promote your own. How dare you promote your own work repeatedly on multiple sub reddits. How dare you participate in the internet. Only other people are supposed to be developing content for Reddit not you.
</p>

<p>Reddit is a travesty of itself. It is a travesty of itself because of how cowardly it is. There is no development of Reddit to place your Skype or Google Hangout name with your user name. It is to be a place of anonymous discussion because how dare Reddit be a place to make friends that you can meet at a coffee shop. How dare someone gain traffic for THEIR work because of Reddit. How dare someone become famous because of Reddit. How dare someone get ahead in life because of Reddit. How dare someone build a following for their work because of Reddit and rob reddit of precious traffic. How dare someone allude to the fact that there are more than one website other than Reddit. The same is true for Facebook. How dare someone in the face of Facebook believe that there is something else than Facebook. How dare someone visit more than one website.
</p>

<p>How dare Conde Nast for impeding the work of a Genius and not growing his genius. How dare someone insinuate that Reddit is more a work of Genius than Facebook. How dare someone point out that all the internet needs is Reddit and a website to work on work to share on website. How dare someone point out that Reddit is the nervous system of the Internet. How dare someone point out that the destruction of reddit has been systematic and intelligent and that the rules that have been placed on Reddit are exactly the kind of rules that Aaron Swartz was stead fast against.
</p>

<p>How dare someone post a link to their own work on Reddit.
</p>

<p>This website is a fraud of itself in light of what it used to be. How dare someone point out that trolling be fought on Reddit when trolling is as much a part of Reddit and the opposite of Trolling. How dare someone point out that Corporate America has a vested interest in down playing the importance and significance of Reddit when Reddit is the website that finishes and polishes off the internet.
</p>

<p>Where Facebook is touted as a work of Genius Reddit is. It's a nervous system again it's a place where you should be able to come and promote our very own work and gain traffic for your own work and then come back to Reddit and scour the Reddit for other websites that you are a fan of. It is to be a place where the internet gains meaning it is built to be a place where the Internet is Glorified.
</p>

<p>It is and has grown stagnant a Billion Dollar purchase purchased for no other reason than to stifle the speech and the transformative abilities of this Genius Website.
</p>
<p>Reddit is frightening to people that have nothing to say and want others to have nothing to say as well. So long as you are a fan of the modern Reddit you are a fan of a work of a Set of Rules intellectually constructed to destroy Reddit.
