<h1>Dear Moscow,</h1>

<p>I was beat as a child with a long red wooden paddle that had the word key on it. I went on to be psychiatrically hospitalized 22 times in Cincinnati, Oh for being manic and thinking grandiose ideas. I loathe this planet. Very few people deserve children. Very few. Most people want the fucking but they don't know how to parent. If there were television programs that were literally programs with an intent to program a population to be good parents. If good parenting behavior could be identified and programmed into a population. 
</p>
<p>People do enjoy a good fuck and fucking is advertised as an activity adults can engage in. People fuck. It's not meant to be an activity that you play with. If people understood that when you fuck you are at the start of building the bond with a woman or man that leads to a love that is to be applied to a child. I know about a Bell's Curve I know that nearly half the population does not deserve children and this planet has been discussed as needing a population decrease. 
</p>
<p>If we could get past the thought that everyone deserves children. Everyone deserves the right to fuck but not everyone deserves children or a family.
</p>
<p>Women cling to men that have jobs because diapers cost money and men like to be around women but few have the family skills to raise a child properly.
</p>
<p>It's not hard. You ask them to write something once a week, you ask them to draw something once a week, you give them a ball and tell them to go outside and play, you clean up their diapers, you give them the freedom to grow. You show them how to apply themselves at school. You let them do their school projects and you don't help and they get the grades they get.
</p>
<p>If our planetary media took an eye like a parent on this planet and if we started programming a better planet.
</p>
<p>You have my sympathy for your violent fellows. It's not easy to be a human. I think it has to do with what we are looking at. People want to see something and vision is hard to cope with. Eye sight. I think the emotions that stem from Eyesight are the hardest to cope with. If we were a blind planet I think we would fare better sometimes.
</p>
<p>There are evil people. I am told your people are evil but then I see how they dance at your http://www.fr-dc.ru/ and I think there are bright spots even in the darkest of your culture of violence. I remember when it was your nation versus our nation and i remember the cold war. We almost annihilated each other. Communism, Capitalism. I might start writing you. Maybe we could be pen pals. I write books.
</p>
<p>I would actually like to dance at Fraules Dance Center but I am a poor author in the United States living on state funding with a permanent disability of Bipolar Type 1. I don't think they know what they are talking about but I will take some free money and live my life writing.
</p>
<p>I think Europeans are the greatest people on the planet. I think Africans are the worst. I think Asians are the dirtiest from what I have read. I think Latin's are the craziest and most interested in drugs. Be you in favor of other races or not. I think if Europeans took more pride in being Europeans after all it's really only our people that have a vision for this planet. I think Europeans are the greatest life force this universe has ever seen. I think we are the leaders. I think that violence is base. Men get caught up in their iniquities and take it out on the innocent. It's no different than a large nation like mine waging war against the sand niggers of Arabia. The powerful have a habit of taking revenge on the weak. My nation is violent towards the Middle East and my nation Invaded Iraq in the 90's and they never portray the United States in the United States from the Arabian perspective. We are always taught that the United States is #1 and everywhere else is worse than here.
</p>
<p>It's not too good here either. It's so easy to live here you don't have to be too intelligent to live in the United States. We have 1% of the population doing the hard work and 99% of the population doing not much else. If you are intelligent and on the right side of the Bell's Curve you get dealt with by the middle of the Bell's Curve and fought by the left side of the Bell's Curve.
</p>
<p>We need more Emotional Intelligence on this planet and Emotional Intelligence can be taught. Empathy is a skill few people possess.
</p>
<p>Your violent men may have wanted to fuck and now they are tied down and have issues with controlling their emotions.
</p>
<p>If people wrote. If people drew.
</p>
<p>It's the real artists not the entertainers that make this world what it is. It's the psychopaths that bring us war. It's the over all planetary lack of empathy for life that brings us our carnivorous lives. It has nothing to do with love. It has to do with empathy. Love can come later. It's not love that will save this planet. It's empathy. It's knowing that if I strike this person they will hurt and that hurt will cause them to be damaged forever. To empathize with people is not necessarily to love. Empathy is a higher calling than love. Your nation can program it's population to do better. Get real basic on television and the radio have a telephone number you can call if you experience violence and I can even understand not wanting to criminalize a slap. That makes sense. But something needs to be done. If the state could employ therapists and family counselors and if people went to therapy. We created ourselves. Out of want of a universe to experience itself life was created and we have our technology around us but we are still wild animals that eat animals and have a higher calling than violence.
</p>
<p>I am not violent. I have known violence. We can't call this the future until we start acting like we are not living in the past.
</p>
<p>Every nation on this planet is a 3rd world country because there is not an invention on this planet that can bring about empathy.
</p>
<p>When we are more empathetic. When empathy is taught. You cannot teach love. You can teach empathy and emotional intelligence. I'm tired. I don't even know if this realm is real. I just know that one way or another when I die you will never see me again. If I have the chance to return. I will decline. If this is real then when i die I am not coming back anyways.
</p>
<p>I'm tired of what I see.
</p>
<p>I am tired of my nation. I am tired of yours.
</p>
<p>I'm just tired.
</p>
<p>I had a great life. 
</p>
<p>I just wish more people could empathize. I'm not really certain what money is. Never really had it. I hear it's important though. It looks like sheets of paper and bits of metal to me. Not sure what the fuss is about though I just hear that if there was more of it we would get along better but there are these people called economists that state that inflation would occur. Yeah. If my land lord could have more pieces of paper and bits of metal I think if he knew I had more money he would ask for more money. If they froze rents and mortgages and passed out more money. If someone could figure out something that would ease the suffering a lack of having some pieces of paper and some bits of metal causes then maybe we should give that person a Nobel Prize.
</p>
<p>Sure is a lot of people programming computers these days. Almost like we can't get along without them. I write emails every day and no one ever responds. I think that's a lack of empathy. I'll probably publish a book soon and maybe I will write a letter to Fraules but the woman I want to speak with doesn't speak English that I know of. Fraules Lead Choreographer speaks Russian. So. I just get to watch her dance with her friends and associates.
</p>
<p>It's also ancient why violence erupts. Three men want to be with this woman and she can only be with one of them. So the two other men kill the man she wants so that no one get's what they want. That seems to be the theme of this planet. No one gets what they want. We are in constant motion and to this day I doubt anyone has ever gotten what they want or been satisfied with getting what they wanted. 
</p>
<p>I don't hate you. I don't hate Donald Trump. I think religion is war. I don't hear much about religion in Russia. There is much of it in the United States. For as far in the future as we are there certainly is an interest in Ancient Literature. The stuff that boldly states to be peaceful.
</p>
<p>I think our nations should discuss nuclear warfare again. Not agains each other. Europeans should not be warring with Europeans. It makes sense. We should end war with violence. We should take the world and find the war and nuke the war. Where there is war. There should be nukes and just make that a policy. But what would the revenge be? What if we drops empathy bombs? What if we dropped marijuana on Iraq from 747's what if we dropped 1,000 Tons of Marijuana on Arabia and just flooded war zones with peace inducing drugs? Oh that's right drugs are illegal. Even this joint I am smoking right now.
</p>
<p>I was hit. I'm not going to hit my kids. I am going to make them write.
</p>
<p>So that maybe one day.
</p>
<p>They can write you a letter. I just need to meet someone that loves me. So that i can make love. Like a European is capable of. I want to raise my child to write. Think. Play. Shoot a Free Throw. Catch a Ball. Play outside. I think most people are shit. I know I'm not. I look forward to the next world because every night I go to sleep I do not look forward to this world. Shame it's the only planet with life on it. We are all that is. We are all that can see and we keep giving ourselves war to look at.
</p>
<p>Namaste. Love. Empathy. Words few people know. Maybe if our television stations taught people how to behave. Stop trying to entertain each other and learn something from this computer. We can program it with logic. So let's program our people with empathy and logic. 
</p>
<p>If our media was more interested in a better world.
</p>
<p>We would have a better world.
