<h1>Negotiation Point With Vegans</h1>

Like Reddit taught me that like cows the things I make my cheese steaks with hella loving pets like you can go out back and sleep with a cow and they'll cuddle with you. Like I see some cows that were saved from getting killed geek the fuck out that they were not getting slaughtered. Like clearly want to live.

Like pigs pigs like being held. LIke the thing I make my ribs with. Sort of likes to nuzzle things. Like I ain know that about pigs.

Chickens don't seem like they are aware. Chickens don't seem like they give a fuck. I think we could just eat chicken and clearly we could just eat fish. It's not like we are animals that think we whould eat dolphins. Shark fin soup is a travesty.
