<h1>Frank and Ze Continual
</h1>
 

<h2>It’s the Conversation that Has Sunrise in It</h2>

<p>It was an apartment in the city. It was a view of the Roebling Bridge just below the penthouse suite of the Cincinnatian. It was the WEBN Fireworks and it was six bottles of Shiraz and two glasses. It was ten o’clock at night and it was a refrigerator filled with fruits and vegetables and nuts and seeds. It was nothing. It was just … nothing … it was nothing. It was a view over the water that was the new water. All of the water made its way down the Ohio River, all of it, and this water was having its chance. It was this water’s turn and there was no one around in the apartment overlooking an epic fireworks spectacle just yet. There were maybe a million people splitting the shores of the Ohio River the very same River that angered Kentucky for not being named the Kentucky River, and Kentucky. That Rand Paul was interested in running for president with an attitude like, it’s the Kentucky River would be the attitude that would get him elected. Someone might want to know what is involved in names and when it’s right on the border you can tell the cartographer was Northern and that border belongs to Ohio apparently and everyone in Kentucky has to speak the name of Ohio every year for the WEBN Fireworks and everyone in Kentucky walks north to the Ohio river and everyone in Ohio walks south to the Ohio river and the Ohio river is oblivious being what it has been since before Christopher Columbus graced these shores, being what it was since before the Iroquois settled camp, being what it is since the glaciers made their way south and pushed the earth forward with its glacier movement that through weight alone pushed dirt and earth forward and reseeded when the planet warmed up again and brought us out of an ice age.
</p>
<p>There was a hotel room overlooking a river that was preparing to spark some fire and light up the sky and there was a room underneath a penthouse that was empty and it had a refrigerator that was filled with veganism and there was some wine and some glasses and over here there was a blender that could do some blender work and it was a night with a hotel room.
</p>
<p>There was a door knob turning and in they walked. First through the door was the lead singer of the Dead Pencil’s Frank Ovaline and he was decked in some gear that he picked up from Ohio Against the World and he just looked like he was against the world with his hair tussed and his shoes sockless and he was against it he was against the world and he was standing near the window beckoning for Ze Picard – Waterfalls to come watch the first fire work fire off. It was pop. Pop. Pop. BRACK! There were sparkles all over the sky.
</p>
<p>Ze stood close to Frank and they had some fireworks to watch. They actually had a lot of fireworks to watch. More than one firework to watch. More than two. And. More than three. They had a night of fireworks to watch.
</p>
<p>Ze walked over to the window and threw some water over the balcony just to watch it fall and then fall some more and then fall some more before it splashed on the concrete below. She just wanted to do that. She just wanted to watch some water fall somehow far was it to the ground water falling how far she just wanted to watch it fall to the ground and make a puddle. She got what she wanted.
</p>
<p>Frank just noticed something. He noticed he had some wine right where he left it.
</p>
<p>“Want some wine Ze?” asked Frank
</p>
<p>“I’ll have a bottle.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I’ll have a bottle too.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>So Frank picked up a bottle of Shiraz and picked up a cork screw and twisted the cork screw into the bottle and started to pull he was yanking and pulling and he was exerting more energy than he should have for such a simple task and then he started to twist and pull and the cork came out to his relief and embarrassment that it took him so much time.
</p>
<p>He handed the bottle of wine to Ze and she tilted her head back and took a giant swig. She just wanted to feel it and she needed to take six more swigs to do so but she was going to take those swigs.
</p>
<p>Frank uncorked his Shiraz and pulled the foils away from the opening of the bottle and took his swig.
</p>
<p>“We’re just standing here.” Said Frank
</p>
<p>The Fireworks were lighting up the room.
</p>
<p>“Not much else to do Frank. “ Said Ze coyly.
</p>
<p>“There is a lot to do.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“We’re doing the do.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Stand there in the window.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Okay.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>Frank pulled out his phone and started to get into photographer mode. He toyed with some settings and pulled up a Lomography capture and was all Ze is his model with the backdrop of the fireworks. He left the light off so that she was silhouetted with the hard back lighting but he wanted her with fireworks lighting up her RapunZel face. He did all the dids and adjusted the ISO and had a softening filter on and he was up really close to her so that on the right side of the frame was her left eye and on the right side of the frame was a fireworks display and he was done.
</p>
<p>Ze said “Modeling is not hard.”
</p>
<p>“I know.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I don’t mind modeling.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“How about this. Ze. Take your shirt off.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Just my shirt.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Just your shirt.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>Ze takes her shirt off and stand in the window. Her tight hourglass was telling the time. She took another big swig of the wine and she was standing there composed.
</p>
<p>“You need to pose me.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>Frank walked over and moved her hands behind her head and had her arch her back he molded her with his hands into a shape and a form she normally would not take.
</p>
<p>Frank stood in front of Ze and started taking photographs in rapid succession and he was auto loading them to Instagram and Ze felt the fame coursing through her body. She sort of cocked her head to the side slightly and looked out of the side of her face at Frank and he kept taking photographs of her.
</p>
<p>Ze started to model. She was staring down the camera and Frank understood the blaze in her eyes. She wanted to do more than model.
</p>
<p>The fireworks were fire working behind her.
</p>
<p>The lead singer of the Dead Pencils was photographing Ze modeling and he started to model as well with the camera in hand.
</p>
<p>She just sort of looked at him.
</p>
<p>“You needed to photograph me with my shirt off.” Said Ze
</p>
<p>“No.” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“You just wanted me to take my shirt off didn’t you.” Said Ze
</p>
<p>“I always want you to take your shirt off.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I can’t always take my shirt off Frank. It gets cold.” Said Ze
</p>
<p>“I don’t want you to always take your shirt off. They are fun to photograph.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“What are fun to photograph, go ahead, you can say it.” Said Ze
</p>
<p>“Your chestesses are fun to photograph. They are. And then you start modeling and I start modeling and we start modeling and it becomes a moment where I like taking photographs and with the fireworks our Instagram just might as well have some decent photographs and the math is amazing a woman, a woman with her shirt off, fireworks, that’s some good man math you know people want to see that.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“How many times have you asked me to take my shirt off Frank?” said Ze
</p>
<p>“Every time I have ever been alone with you.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I get that. I get that you want me to take my shirt off.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I get that you don’t mind being a model. Thank you.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>They be working on their wine.
</p>
<p>“Hey.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Hey.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“We have four more bottles.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“We do.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Alright.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“How about this.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I’ll take my pants off for you when you hand me the bottle of wine.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Okay.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>Frank walks over and notice something. Just. The Masses. It’s like you can’t have mass without a mass of people. It’s like it’s not a ceremony it’s a thing. Going to mass. Like Ohio and Kentucky holds mass once a year and they celebrate with fireworks and it’s just something that they do. Coming together for a mass. A mass of people. A mass of understanding.
</p>
<p>“Frank, I need the wine to take my pants off.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Yeah.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>Frank walks over and gets involved in uncorking some wine and he makes a decision. He takes out six glasses from the cupboard and he just starts pouring glasses. He starts pouring glasses of wine and Zoe sees what he is preparing to do and is like:
</p>
<p>“No. Just give me the bottle.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Goddamn.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>Frank hands Ze the bottle and she kicks her head back and takes a swill of the wine and just looks out the window. She’s getting the photograph she wants and there is nothing stopping her.
</p>
<p>“You have a photograph you need to take for my Instagram.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“You mean that photograph.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I’ll take my clothing off slowly and you just keep taking photographs.” Said Ze
</p>
<p>“Just remember to keep your eyes on the camera.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Alright.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>There were fireworks in the background and the different colors were captivating and it was a moment like this that kept a relationship revolving. Instagram. Place to showcase some time spent doing something. Doing something, with all of the places you can place pieces of time spent doing something. Time spent taking clothing off and time spent putting them back on.
</p>

<p>Frank had his nice camera cock eyed and he had the flash on and Ze, Ze was taking the night into her hands and she was motivating the camera shutter to capture her taking the time to put on a show. She was putting on her show. The same show she put on every time she was alone with Frank. The same show. The same show Instagram had a catalog of shots of.
</p>
<p>“Take your pants off Frank.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“You don’t want to be only one naked.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“No, we aren’t getting naked. We are just going to take some photographs.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>Ze picked up her pants and she wrapped them around her neck and pulled the tops and bottoms of the pants down around her and she had her attitude on and she was staring down that camera with every ounce of da fuck kind of world are we living in that develops a need for this many photographs and this much content and asks this much of a group of people that could very well be spending all of their time at the bar like tradition speaks of but we got all of this extra work to do and the content management system be spying on all of us and making certain the women are as naked as they can be as often as possible and some people that don’t know how to talk to women are staring at the people that do wondering what the secret to life is that makes people fall in love and Ze is standing there with her top folded and cropped up and you can see the bottom cleavage and her entire lower half which some people would call her better half but really it’s her more frightening half and Ze and Frank already had the conversation where they talk about the lower half and how men have an outie and women have an innie and we are all basically the same and evolved into a situation where we got some props to play with that we ain have when we were kids and the Nintendo entertainment system robbed millions of people of their ability to take their clothing off but we still need a new generation and it’s all awkward and some people had some intuition to keep eyes on this machine that has been given to us and if you need a reason to see someone naked you can just ask and when you whip out the camera and the wine you can model for Instagram and we can all have wood stock like Ze and Frank here spending time and then …
</p>
<p>“Bend over Ze.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>Ze bent over and exposed her hot and she wondered if this was the it that was all the it that there was to do and she was like we could be playing video games or we could be drinking wine and taking our clothing off and Frank was like :
</p>
<p>Playing some Carl XOX from his phone and he had it emitting radio frequencies to the speakers he had on blue tooth and now it was Ze in another world with some of that four four playing and they weren’t playing video games but they were playing with their clothing and it was a moment like this that kept everyone single because this was marriage and tranquility and this was the mating dance of the future and the nakedity was just waiting for the Instagram to be something that was like Facebook needed a photograph of you naked and you were just waiting to take that photograph and the world was waiting to see you strutting around with your clothing off and the FCC don’t scare me but the FCC better scare you to keep within the rules and remember what we don’t want to see and just what we want to and when was the last time you and your special someone got together in a hotel room overlooking the fireworks and had a night where you just get together with Zelda and do that stuff you do when you found Zelda because Zelda was sitting there waiting for with no idea what you had to do to find her and she just knows you aren’t the dark prince and fuck him anyways and now you have your hotel room and you are with Zelda and you got a camera and an Instagram account and enough wine to take away your cares and you just for the fuck of it bought a basketball just to pop a three pointer and you left the ball on the court and now you alone with Ze in the room just below the pent house and the fireworks are all going off and you can tell the world is wondering what you going to do next and you going to take some photographs and then she is going to take some photographs of Frank naked and for a night during labor day a man and a woman are going to pad their Instagram account and do that thing that everyone is born waiting to do … spending some time naked with someone.
</p>
<p>There was drinking to do. Oh there was some drinking to do. There was some drinking L E F T to do. There was a bottle of Shiraz left. Frank picked up the bottle and just started drinking. Ze was left standing there. She had a thought that for a brief moment Frank enjoyed the Shiraz more than he enjoyed spending time with her. It was just a thought. She frownied for a second watching him drink the Shiraz with passion. He wanted him to have passion for nothing but her. She didn’t want him to have passion for the band, for life, for his mother, for work, for anything but her. She just wanted him to have passion for her.
</p>
<p>The Shiraz was gone. The intoxication was real. That liquid that was pressed grapes and was fermented and aged and placed in bottles was gone. Frank was laying on the bed holding Ze.
</p>
<p>Frank motioned to Ze to go into the bedroom. The fireworks were fireworks but there were some fireworks in Frank that needed a bedroom to see. Ze jumped into the bedroom. They laid in the bed and Frank pulled Ze close.
</p>
<p>“You wanna talk?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Yeah we can talk.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>Frank pulled Ze a little tighter underneath those Hilton smooth as lotion sheets.
</p>
<p>“What do you want to talk about?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Let’s talk about us.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“You want to talk about us?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Yeah let’s talk about us?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“How long have we known each other?” said Ze
</p>
<p>“We met in an AOL Chat Room a long time ago.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Am I your girl? Are you, the lead singer of the Dead Pencil’s willing to let me know I am your girl?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I mean I thought that was obvious?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Nooooo. Nooooo it’s not.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Oh.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>The fireworks were over and it was just blackness in the room. It was dark and a shade of blue that was carefully covering the entire room.
</p>
<p>“How about we get married?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“No.” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Why not?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Because I’m not ready.” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I am. We make a good couple we should do this for a couple decades.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“That’s a long time.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“How about you move in?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I could move in.” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“That’s like marriage.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“No it’s not. It’s not like marriage at all.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“How about I throw a party the day you move in and we invite all our friends over for a party to celebrate you moving in?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>‘Uuuuum maybe. Is that marriage?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Yes.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Then no. I’ll just move in quietly and we can throw a party the week after I move in so it’s not about my moving in.” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Okay.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I always said I was never getting married.” Said Ze.
</p>

<p>“Do you want children?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I like my life.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“You can like your life and have children.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I don’t know about that. You have to focus all of your attention on a kid or two.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Two.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Yes I want two kids.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Okay.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“If I get pregnant we’ll get married.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I’m saving myself for marriage so you won’t get pregnant.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“We made love the other night.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Not married love.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“What’s married love?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“That’s where I don’t use a condom.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Well I need kids if we are going to get married.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“So I guess we should just hold each other.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Well I want to do other stuff too.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“But we’re not married.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“You’re not serious.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I want to be serious.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“What is marriage?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“It’s where two people bring all the people that would cheat on each other with somewhere central so that a priest can bless the union and warn everyone that these two people are serious about each other and they would appreciate it if hands offies would be taken into account.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“You mean the best man and the maid of honor.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Yeah those are the people you most assume are going to try and get involved in your significant other life and you are putting them on blast and pointing out that you have your eye on them.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>Ze wobbles her head from side to side and says,
</p>
<p>“That sounds like marriage we can throw the party when I move in. I don’t want to miss a party.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Cool.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“It’s a nice bed.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“It is.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“You really want to get married just like that? What kind of proposal was that?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Alright. I’ll surprise you with a better marriage proposal later. I just thought you might like a casual proposal.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“No. I want there to be balloons involved.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“And I ring right? How about a crown?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I don’t know if I can wear a crown.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“You can wear a ring though?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Yeah. Like rings are comfy.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Maybe I’ll have a message inscribed inside the ring.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Like what?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I like you.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Fraaaank!” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“What?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I like you!” Exclaimed Ze.
</p>
<p>“Yeah it seems nice.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I would always laugh.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Maybe that’s why I will do it.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I’ll let you know when you can get me a ring. I’ll give you a sign.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I’ll wait for a sign.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I might not want to marry you. I might just want to be your girl.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“You think marriage is scary?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Yeah a priest is involved. Those people frighten me. They wear black every day.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Oh. Well. We could ask a bartender to do it.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“NOOOO! We’re not getting married in a bar.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“But we’re getting married?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“You tricked me!” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I mean sort of. Is there anything wrong with tricking someone into marriage?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Yes. It has to be a mutual agreement.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>Frank rolled Ze over on top of him and they were laying face to face facing the ceiling.
</p>
<p>“We should kiss.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“No. I want to talk and you can’t talk while you are kissing.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>Frank reaches his lips forward and kissed Ze on the chin.
</p>
<p>“No. I’m laying on top of you I am giving you a body kiss. I need my mouth for other things.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Like what?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Making sound.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Alright. Well. What if I kissed your neck while you talked?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“That.” Ze looked out of the corner of her eye and paused for a second.
</p>
<p>“That might work.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>Frank proceeded to place his lips on Ze’s neck and he began to massage her nape.
</p>
<p>“Frank. Frank. Fraaaaank. Frank! That feels good.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“It’s supposed to.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Just because we are alone in this hotel room doesn’t mean we should be making babies.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“You can’t make a baby with your mouth.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“But it might lead to making babies and we can’t make babies before we get married.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“We have nine months to plan a wedding. That’s a lot of time.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I need to interview you.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Interview?” said Frank pulling on Ze’s hair a little bit.
</p>
<p>“Ouch! And yeah.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Who are you?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I’m Frank the Lead Singer of the Dead Pencil’s.” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Okay. Do you know who I am?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“You’re Ze the woman I met at in an AOL Chat Room a long time ago.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Yes. So now we know we know who each other is.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“We’ve known who each other is for a long time.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I like your AOL Screen Name. It was DeadPen.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I remember. I was DeadPen on Aol. You were Zebra.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I was proud of Zebra. I felt striped and I was AOL’s Zebra.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I felt like I was making a comment on all of the people that quit or never wrote.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“You were deep. We used to go into private chats and oh Frank we chatted for so many hours.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“You lived with your parents I lived with my parents and we just monopoliZed the computer.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“My parents didn’t like me chatting with you on AOL. They said you were going to steal me.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I never intended to steal you.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“You didn’t, I gave myself to you. We’re a couple. I considered you my boyfriend a long time ago.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“You’re my girl. We make a good couple.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Am I entertaining?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Extremely.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I learned how to type because of you.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I didn’t know that.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Yeah it was hard at first chatting with you but you made it worth it. If I had never learned to type we would not have worked out. I had to learn to do something to be friends with you.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Wow! I don’t know why I stood out from the crowd.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“BECAUSE YOU WERE DEAD PEN! You made fun of a lot of people and it made me laugh.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Oh you mean my trolling. Yeah. I pissed a lot of people off.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“But not in a bad way. In a mischievous way. I used to laugh at what you wrote.
</p>
<p>Like when you oh whatever’s I can’t think of anything right now. I just remember laughing at what you wrote in the main chat rooms. Then in private you were special to me not like your main room self at all.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I liked to chat. You always responded.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I was afraid you wouldn’t respond if I didn’t respond.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I was afraid you were an old woman.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Well, I’m not. I’m younger that you. And cute.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“And you like to take your shirt off.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“It’s off right now.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>Frank flipped Ze over on her back and he pulled her up so that her head was beside his head and her back was on his chest and then he proceed to wrap his hand around her body and began to massage her chest.
</p>
<p>“Don’t stop doing that.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I wasn’t planning on it.” Said Frank.
</p>
<h2>Chapter 2
</h2>
<p>Frank and Ze wake up at 11:59am just in time for check out. Ze looked around the room.
</p>
<p>“Frank we partied.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“It looks like party.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Some hacienda woman is going to have to clean this up.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I know. We paid good money to party here for the fireworks last night.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>The Fireworks; the City of Cincinnati’s gift to the region where Rozzi’s is getting its show boat together and they put together a terrific display of light and color. It’s the light and color that change the world and when half a million to a million people are involved in a Firework’s display it gets interesting and the world is better served by a group of people interested in bathing in the light that the colors represent.
</p>
<p>“Do you have plans today?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Following you around.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Alright. Well. I’m going back to my apartment.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Can I comes?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“You can come.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Yays.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>After finishing checking out. Frank and Ze walk down the street until they come across Frank’s Car.
</p>
<p>“Your car is ugly.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“It’s rubber on the road.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“You need to do more shows so you can get a prettier.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“We got a big one coming up.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“How long have you been in the Dead Pencil’s?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“My whole life! We have our biggest tour to date coming up and I have to get ready for it..” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Get a job and just perform at one place.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“What?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Yeah. Get jobs and just do shows at one place. Just keep doing shows at the same place and do it up all nice and be a local band.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“We could start there.” Said Frank sort of softly like he was surprised to be getting band advice from Ze and wondering to himself if the “Dead Pencil’s” had a future.
</p>
<p>“Are you on social mediums?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I have a Facebook account.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Well, you need to pass out flyers for your shows. Pass them out.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“A band can pass out a lot of flyers.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Make em nice.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Are you my band manager now?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Neeew. I want to be though. I always wanted to manage a band.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Not us. Not the band I am in. Not now. It’s sort of a big deal to have a band manager and we just play music. The show coming up is big it’s big enough to be intimidated by. It’s a show that is at the Northside Tavern. There could be three hundred people there. Big show.” Said Frank.
</p>

<p>Frank walked up to check out and introduced himself.
</p>
<p>“I want to check out.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Name?” said the mysterious clerk that is standing there.
</p>
<p>“Frank Ovaltine.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Mr. Ovaltine you are fine to leave.” Said the Clerk.
</p>
<p>“Thank you.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Yays.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“For real let’s go back to the apartment. It’s almost Monday and you have some class to attend and I have some band practice to attend to and we need to cut this holiday short but not yet.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I have a drawing class on Monday.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Cool. Maybe you could draw me sometime.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I can draw you. That sounds fun.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Life without television is like that.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“How long have you been without television?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I mean the last time I watched television seven days in a week was like ten years ago.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Wow. Just. For real?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Yeah I mean I’m like practicing something.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>‘I got you. I’m practicing something too.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“What are you practicing?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Deez Nuts.” Said Ze in the softest cutest most adorable way you could imagine ‘deez nuts’ being said with a ring around her face filled with ancient aura’s of playfulness.
</p>
<p>“I never thought I would fall for that.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“You did.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Alright everything is in order sir.” Said the Clerk.
</p>
<p>“Thank you.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Alright Ze, let’s be going.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>The front of the hotel looked expensive. It was the Cincinnatian. It had history and it had opulence and it had two people that experienced fireworks the night before. There was strangely just three people in the lobby. It was the clerk and Frank and Ze. Ze waved goodbye as they walked out the revolving door of the Cincinnatian.
</p>
<p>The City. Oh the City. The Downtown extravagance of sidewalks and windows and pigeons and the world was people and concrete in the center of the city and there were suits and khaki’s walking around and Frank even saw a pair of sweat pants and a pair of gloves. It was the magnet that draws the commuters in from the suburbs.
</p>
<p>Frank started to walk down to Republic Street. He had an apartment to tend to. It was just a fancy night out that Frank wanted to share with Ze. He liked her.
</p>
<p>“Frank?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Yeah Ze.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“How many fireworks do you think they shot off last night?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“All of em.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“You think they left any out?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“No.” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“They did.” Said Ze who then stopped Frank in his tracks and gave him a peck on the lips.
</p>
<p>“Fireworks!” said Ze after having just kissed Frank.
</p>
<p>“You smidgeon.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“What is a smidgeon?” asked Ze.
</p>
<p>“It’s a pauper that likes to kiss.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I’m not a pauper.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I used to be a pauper then I became an adult.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Are you saying I’m not an adult?” said Ze
</p>
<p>“I mean maybe.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“You mean happenstance.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“It’s a statement. I just reacted that’s all. I’m not in a good mood. I drank too much wine.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“You did drink more than me.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Hello.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>Ze could see he was on the phone.
</p>
<p>“Yes we need a taxi at Fountain Square to take us uptown.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>Frank was standing there holding his hand up to his ear and was trying to block out the sounds of the street.
</p>
<p>“Yes. I am wearing brown pants and a yellow shirt.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“No. I am not Charlie Brown.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“We just need to wait here.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“You do look like Charlie Brown.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Alright I look like Charlie Brown.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“What?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I’m hung over. I don’t have time for much.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Oh.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Yeah. That wine had it’s way with me.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I feel fine.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“You would.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Oh are you upset that I am not hung over?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Not upset but jealous super super super super jealous.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Is there anything I can do?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“You can be yourself. Just stay the same.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Otay.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“There see that. Just keep doing that.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Tut?”said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Exactly.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Can you call me a cab?” said Frank to the Hotel Clerk.
</p>
<p>“Yes. I can have a cab come right away.” Said the Hotel Clerk.
</p>
<p>“Oh. We are taking a cab?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Yes. I’m not taking the bus.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>The morning after the day that the decisions made the night prior come to fruition. If you drank yourself into a stupor you feel stupid this day.
</p>
<h2>Chapter 3
</h2>
<p>Frank opened the cab door. He got in.
</p>
<p>“Mount Healthy.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I gotchu!” Said the Cab Driver.
</p>
<p>“My spot.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“We’re not getting married.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I never said we were I said I wanted us to.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>Frank was looking out the window. He was pulling Ze close. It was the kind of cab that had soot on the ground. Frank was outside himself thinking of himself wondering about himself letting himself hold Ze. He was happy she was a girl. He was happy she loved him. He was happy they had a nice night out. It was the opulence of it all coupled with the meagerness of his life. He had nothing. He had a band. He had some people to play with. It was all of it was all of it and he was watching buildings pass by.
</p>
<p>Ze was thinking of candy. She was thinking of tootsie pops. She was thinking of sugar rain. She was thinking of all of the things a happy woman girl lady bemusement would be thinking of after being held all night and made happy. She was wine still drinking. She was opening herself up to someone. She was with someone.
</p>
<p>“You have a class you are going to are you not?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“It’s a holiday I’ll skip this class.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I’m not a very good influence on you.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Whatever. I never took a break from class before. I have perfect attendance.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Don’t they fail you if you miss more than three classes?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I’ll draw you and bring it in for extra credit. I’ll do some extra credit work so you’ll have to pose for me. My professor would appreciate it if I missed class and brought in some drawings. It will be like I never missed.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Your professor is cool like that?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Yes.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I don’t have any materials.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I do.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“You have drawing materials?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Yeah. I have a set of pencils and some large papers.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Then maybe I could go to class today. I supposed you have internet access?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Yeah.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Alright. I will write my professor and let him know that I have a model and that
</p>
<p>I am going to do a session today.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Just like that. I have a Masonite board too.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Perfect. Surprisingly perfect. You would have the things I need.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“You just want to get me naked.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“You do have to get naked.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Are we really doing this?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I’m not a failure.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“We’re in Mount Healthy.” Said the driver.
</p>
<p>“Right down on the left.” Said Frank pointing the way.
</p>
<p>“Cool.” Said the Driver.
</p>
<p>Frank paid the driver and got out the car. His spot was down a ways but it wasn’t a walk. He walked in and Ze was like
</p>
<p>“Oh.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“You are an artist.” Said Ze a beat later.
</p>
<p>“I ended up an artist. I didn’t plan on becoming one.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I’ll have to pose you here.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“You can pose me.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Let me see the supplies.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“These?” said Frank walking through his apartment picking some things up. He had some pencils and the paper was nicely siZed.
</p>
<p>“That paper is huge!” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“It’s packing paper. I got it for a steal on Amazon.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“It’s a new day so we have work to do.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I took a couple drawing classes I can help, I’ll even do some poses your instructor never thought of. Playful ones.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“You would pose for drawings? Photographs is one thing but drawings?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“If you need class credit I’ll help you. It can be what we do today.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I need to be serious.” Said Ze.
<p></p>
</p>“Well let’s get serious. Here.” Said Frank.

<p>Frank then gave her a stack of pages. He handed her a Masonite board. He turned on a light.
</p>
<p>“What more do you need?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Nothing. A place to sit.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Sit on the floor.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Well I need warm up first. Some gestures.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Alright. Well. I need to get my head in the game. Let me move some things around in my apartment.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>Frank proceeded to clear out a space that was well lit by the lamps.
</p>
<p>“What kind of pose do you need or want?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I love you.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“It’s for your schooling.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“You said schooling all proper.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I had proper schooling. I graduated from the University.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“You do enough shows for this apartment?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“The record label pays for it. I don’t get most of what I make. I get what I need and the record label keeps the rest. Our album sells fairly well.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Alright. Alright. So we are going to do this. It takes three hours.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“No it takes two. We are going to cheat.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“No it takes three and we are not. I won’t cheat.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Okay.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Okay. Wait.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“What?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“We are moving too fast.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“It’s class time. That’s go time.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“No. It’s stop time. We can do it tomorrow.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“So what are we going to do right now, today?” asked Frank.
</p>
<p>“I have to think about it.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“How about to make it easier I sit on the computer in the wooden chair?” said Frank
</p>
<p>“You would do it?” said Ze
</p>
<p>“Yes.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I don’t want to lose my scholarship.” Said Ze
</p>
<p>“Then let’s start drawing.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Well hold on it can’t happen like that.” Said Ze
</p>
<p>“Why can’t it?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Well, I need to get in the mood.” Said Ze
</p>
<p>“Alright. Mood. I got mood covered. Just let me … “ said Frank.
</p>
<p>Frank proceeded to pull up Spotify and he played “Hello” my Adele. The sound began to waft over the rafters and it created the rafters that it would play over. The song was drifting through some speakers and it was intertwining with the melodies of the harmonies of the what was now a set.
</p>
<p>“Hello?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“HELLO!” said Frank
</p>
<p>“Oh. I’m supposed to be getting my drawing supplies together aren’t I?” said Ze
</p>
<p>“Yes.” Said Frank
</p>
<p>“Ok.” Said Ze
</p>
<p>Ze proceeded to set up the table in a drawing pose. She pulled out the packing paper and laid out a sheet before her.
</p>
<p>“It’s nice drawing paper isn’t it?” said Frank
</p>
<p>“Yeah. Yeah it is.” Said Ze
</p>
<p>Adele was on a loop right now so she was getting paid. Frank liked to think of listening to music in the modern age like playing the stock market in reverse. He keeps playing the music of the people he thinks have meaning and depth to them so that the meaning and the depth get played and so that some statistics on some screen somewhere flicker in the favor of his favorite artists.
</p>
<p>“Ok. Quiets.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>Frank was still.
</p>
<p>“Just sit there.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>Frank just sat.
</p>
<p>Ze began began to trace Frank’s image on the page. It all happened so quickly. Ze was just tracing him in his clothing and the chair. She knew this was a gestural drawing so she did it quickly. Then she did a blind contour drawing and didn’t look at the page once. Then she did another gestural drawing. She was more into this drawing session than one at work at school at that place where they over see your drawing. She sharpened her pencil several times and she had twelve gestures on the single sheet of paper. She didn’t know if she was talented but she knew she was learning and she was taking on the scope of the instance of the moment that was Adele was not playing any more now it was The Weekend with “Often” and he was strafing the speakers with a soft oo yeah and it was like the music and the movements of her pencil were becoming one and she was tantalizing herself with the moment. Last night she was at the Cincinnatian and tonight she was in Frank’s space and she was drawing and she was letting Frank be her subject. She didn’t see him anymore she saw the shapes that were him. She was focusing her University training and she was at a point where she needed more University in her system.
</p>
<p>“Frank.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Yes.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I need you to take your clothing off and turn the chair backwards.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Okay.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>Frank then proceeded to take his shirt off and he took his pants off and he was standing there with some hairs on his chest and his dick was covered in fur and his legs had a beautiful sheen of hair on him and his European elegance shined and “Diamonds” was on the radio and Rhianna was speaking her piece and Ze was posing Frank.
</p>
<p>“Okay. Now use the computer just with the chair backwards and sit there naked.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Very University of You.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Truly. I’m not scholarship for no reason.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“You just thought this would be a big deal?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“It is.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Do you think your professor will tender this work?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I think my Professor Professor Mardles will appreciate it. Just sit.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>Ze proceeded to by the music of David Gray, Sarah McLachlan, over the course of
</p>
<p>Frank Ocean she just stared at Frank.
</p>
<p>She was thinking all of thoughts and she was thinking of drawing him. She was staring at him and really looking at him and she was thinking of the playfulness from last night and how she had a good time and there was wine and she was thinking of how they didn’t make love and he wasn’t just trying to get into her pants and he was someone and there was a band that he played with and there were shows coming up and she was going to meet a lot of people and the pencil was coursing across the page and Frank was appearing in page after page and she was capturing him she captured him in a way she didn’t capture the models at the University. She captured him on the computer playing music over and over and she was drawing in music notes and she was creating compositions and she was doing graphic design and the drawings were comprised of more than lines they were gestures and she was with him and they were in this space and she was not getting bored the way she does in studio and she wanted to let her professor know that she wanted to draw at home more often and this was more than homework this was getting and A and she knew it she knew she was in class today and she was a responsible student that was saved by another responsible person and she was going to keep her scholarship and she was going to draw Frank on this table and he was going to play some more Imagine Dragon’s and she was going to listen to more Adele and he was going to play Dave Mathews Band and they were going to listen to music and she was going to draft images of him through drawing and he was going to be remembered for some time in this pose.
</p>
<p>Frank and a Computer.
</p>
<p>“Frank.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Yeah.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Would you lay on the ground?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>Frank placed a singer songer writer radio on Spotify and left the computer.
</p>
<p>Thhhhhhhen Frank laid his ass on the ground.
</p>
<p>“You know this is good for me. I like a powerful woman and I can’t think of anything a woman can do more powerful than this, except for being pregnant, but this too, and just ordering me around.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Stoop. Stop it Frank, My clothes are staying on. I was naked last night which wasn’t that long ago.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“What? Da fuck you talking about?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Oh. I thought this was going to segue into more naked time.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“No. I was just mentioning how you seem powerful right now.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Stop talking. I have to draw.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>Ze proceeded to trace the contours of Frank.
</p>
<h2>Chapter 4
</h2>
<p>It was midnight. Ze and Frank were laying on a mattress staring at the ceiling. They had their socks on and their hair was tussled. They had been laying there for about an hour. Ze was asleep. Frank was staring at the ceiling. Frank was certain staring at the ceiling was meditation because he had a lot of thoughts going through his head and he wasn’t doing anything so instead of calling doing this staring at the ceiling meditation. It seemed appropriate to him to call it meditation. Ze was out. Frank was sort zoned out in a way that happened every night. He just had this string of thoughts that went through his mind and he remembered it was time to do his taxes. Frank’s meditation space was always difficult to remember but like, man, he knew it was real and it was therapeutic and frightening at times and he never remembered what he meditated on but he knew he spent a lot of time exploring inner space. He didn’t know how or with what but as a functioning human being he knew that his inner space was like that part of him that was not outside of himself and he knew it was epic. There was thought inside of him and outside of him there was space.
</p>
<p>Frank knew that. He knew inside of him was thought. His ceiling had a ceiling fan and the ceiling fan spun and he stared at it at night and when he was staring at it at night he let it hypnotiZe him. He did this thing where he would follow one fan blade around in a circle with his eyes and it helped him meditate. Sometimes he would think to himself that a ceiling fan wasn’t much and that it was a motor with some blades sticking out of it. If he wanted to make out he could get a motor and his ceiling fan would be different it would be more windy and the blade would be more tangential to the ground instead of parallel and his would produce wind so that you could use it to dry off with. It would produce a lot of wind he knew and it would only have two blades. Not four and he would do it just to make them by hand. His goal would be to install a single ceiling fan in a client’s house so that he could know for certain that he did something that someone else thought was cool and used. Like a ceiling fan.
</p>
<p>Ze was dreaming. She was dreaming of a pea cock feather floating in a lake. There was a fish in the lake and it was happy.
</p>
<p>Frank was still staring at the ceiling. He stood up and left Ze on the mattress. She sort of woke up a bit and was like
</p>
<p>“Frank, come back here.” Intoned Ze.
</p>
<p>“I need to do something." Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“What?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I need to smoke.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Whattya smoking?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I was just going to roll a pinner.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Oh. Can I fun?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“You can fun with me.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>Ze stood up and she took the blanket with her and she just didn’t want to be cold even though she was stone cold right now.
</p>
<p>Frank had some real Marijuana that he pulled from his pouch. He had some real stuff. It wasn’t weed. It was the hallucinogenic weed that provided more meditation space. It was the real.
</p>
<p>He had a zig zag and he did what he said he was going to do. He rolled a pinner. It wasn’t that special. It wasn’t a party roll. It wasn’t a festival roll. It was a pinner. Something that only happens in the apartment.
</p>
<p>“You can light it.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>Ze picked up the lighter and the pinner and cocked her head to the side and took an inhale.
</p>
<p>“The fun.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Ain it.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“We could have been prohibitionists this whole time.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I know. We could have our clothing on too.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I know. We could drink apple juice instead of hard cider.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I know. We could drink water instead of moon shine.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I know. We could be better people.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I know.” Said Frank as he pulled the pinner from Ze he cocked his head to the side and took in a deep inhale and just looked up. There wasn’t a ceiling fan either. There wasn’t Ze’s face either. He tilted his head down and there she was standing there in the blanket and she had this look like she was cool like she was just cool like she was high right now and she was sort of looking at Frank and Frank was sort of looking at her and they were both and it was one of those moments where nothing is more interesting to look at than a set of eyes for any length of time just eyes can be looking at eyes and sometimes you have to be careful to actually be looking someone in the eye and he caught Ze being a certain way.
</p>
<p>“What?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“You darted right to my pupils.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Yes.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“You were looking at my cheeks and then I saw you click up.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Yeah!” said Ze smiling.
</p>
<p>“I just noticed.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Alright I can look you in the eyes if I want to.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I know. I just noticed that you did.” Sad Frank.
</p>
<p>“Alright.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>Frank was inhaling the last of the pinner and he was in sufficient and he was pretty certain she was too.
</p>
<p>“Are you sufficient?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“No.” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“You’re not?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“No. If it was up to me we would smoke two more.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“We have plenty.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Then roll two more and we each get one.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>So Frank pursed his lips and dropped his chin to the side and made a cool smile and smirked his lips and said :
</p>
<p>“Okay. Ze. Two more coming right up.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>Ze nodded her head and was like :
</p>
<p>“Good.”
</p>
<p>So Frank started to roll two more. He made them fatties and he was aiming to please. She wanted her own to smoke and he didn’t mind smoking another one so tonight they were getting blaZed. He reached down and gave it a tug just because he was oblivious and she noticed him and she went :
</p>
<p>“You give it tugs?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“What?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Your man, you gave your man a pull?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Yeah. Yeah I gave it a tug.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I just noticed.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“You ever rub you tits? “ said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Sometimes.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Alright then.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>Ze noticed he was done rolling two Marijuana Cigarettes and he slid one across  the table to her. She stopped it from rolling onto the floor.
</p>
<p>There was one lighter and Frank had it in his hand.
</p>
<p>He lit his cigarette and then he reached out and lit Ze’s.
</p>
<p>They were sitting there and Frank walked over and laid down on the mattress. It was a comfortable mattress and Ze walked over too and got in on the other side.
</p>
<p>They were laying there listening to nightfall and smoking Marijuana.
</p>
<p>It was one of those nights and there wasn’t much else to do it was more of a Meditation Studio than people realiZed. It was in want of a television and radio. It had a pc that was hooked up to the internet that was currently playing some night time melodies from Spotify and it was perfect. There wasn’t a party going on and there wasn’t several doZen people milling about and honestly Ze and Frank have talked about this and they have talked about how they don’t have many friends they have met a lot of people in life but they don’t have many friends in that there aren’t many people they can just call on the phone that will come over and play or drink and it’s been one of those lives.
</p>
<p>“We met not too long ago didn’t we?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Yeah. We were the two lonely birds flying solo at the Comet.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“We just happened to be at the bar.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“You asked me if I wanted to play pool.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“You said yes.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I did.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“How long did we play pool for?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“We played about four games and then you invited me back here.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“You’re still here.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I know. I like it here. It’s quiet.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I try to keep it that way.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“It’s been about two weeks.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I know. I’m not saying anything. It’s nice being around you.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Thank you.” Said Ze who then rolled over and pulled Frank’s nose and then rolled back.
</p>
<h2>Chapter 5
</h2>
<p>Ze be all like , sittin there playing with a basket. She is running her fingers along it’s weaved wooden sides and she runs her fingers along it’s handle. She’s sitting there wondering if she will ever weave a basket.
</p>
<p>“Say La Vie.” Said Ze to herself.
</p>
<p>“Datch Ya Doing?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Sittin here.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I don’t know.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Yeah.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“So.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>Ze breathes a sigh.
</p>
<p>Frank looks at Ze.
</p>
<p>Ze looks at Frank.
</p>
<p>A moment passes.
</p>
<p>Frank walks over to the computer. Sits down.
</p>
<p>Thinks to himself.
</p>
<p>| I d o n ‘ t k n o w |
</p>
<p>Places his right hand on the mouse and pauses for a second.
</p>
<p>Has a moment.
</p>
<p>Sort of looks over his shoulder at Ze.
</p>
<p>Has a moment.
</p>
<p>Thinks about his right hand.
</p>
 

<p>Shakes his head.
</p>
<p>| t h a t t h e r e w o u l d e v e r b e a m o m e n t t h a t I p l a c e m y r i g h t h a n d o n a m o u s e .|
</p>
<p>Then he takes his right hand and moves it horizontally on the z plane it rests on and slides a cursor along the x axis and the y axis of a collection of pixels that just so happen to be formulated right in front of him and he moves the cursor south direct t a green circle with three black lines curved into it.

<p>He thinks to himself.
</p>
<p>|W i l l I e v e r s u b s c r i b e t o T i d a l M a g a z i n e ?” A s t h o u g h |
</p>
<p>He clicks on Spotify.
</p>
<p>Pulls up his current playlist.
</p>
<p>He be all sitting there after some | W h a t ? |
</p>
<p>He thinks to himself about how many hours he has spent listening to something invisible. Something like wallpaper. This thing. This valuable as paint thing. That people spend time coloring the what with? He is just sitting there pulling up his as close as he can describe it list of songs that he is most interested if someone would ask him the most certain question…
</p>
<p>What do you listen to you?
</p>
<p>It’s a question he has never been asked more than if he is being honest some seventy two or ninety eight times but he always has a funny way of answering it. He has to his recollection always felt like he listens to if Frank is being honest listening to corporatica or group work or production studio equipment or tools of trade now some eighty thousands hours having been of wanting to be alive but he just if he is a certain way about the numbers in some sense alright eighty thousand hours of being alive just thinking maybe taking into consideration future thoughts that his current thoughts may or may not be aware of on this how does memory work again and that there may be something to wondering if the human psyche is aware of itself in a past present and future sense in that maybe his present sense through recalling a moment in what could be considered the past is in fact not so much pulling from memory but accessing a moment through some if there was ever something that never moved it would be the mind in it’s encapsulated existence and that at any given moment if there was something capable of focusing on shifting the position of a universe it would be a focused mind recollecting a thought coupled with a when was the last time he listened to

<p>Busy Child<br>

Crystal Method<br></p>

<p>and he is just sitting there spending time wondering of the songs in his robust library playlist that he wishes played more advertisements as from time to time he just wants to know more about some businesses that would be interested in supporting the invisible wall paper business and would just be interested in a post media world of just who the fuck really gives a shit about music because he knows maybe it shouldn’t be playing in grocery stores even though he is really excited every time he hears someone’s song made it onto the grocery list and if people really wanted to know if they made it it would be if anyone ever listened to your song while shopping in the

<p>And he just has this wall paper collection that he has access to and he just it’s everywhere and produced by a couple people and he is just sitting there listening to role models with their emotive explanations of why they give a fuck about a recording studio and it’s like the least that could happen is that they take it seriously and Spotify if he was being honest would sit you down once a week and really serve the advertisers and really treat it like a informational session and to be a certain way about it that if you have a Spotify subscription and you want to listen to music for a year without advertising that Spotify would have a moment where it would realiZe that in the action of pressing play someone or something or a group of people or all of it was present and that this thing isn’t a radio that when the music is playing on this thing someone is sitting there and that it’s not a car stereo that no one knows anything about and that if there was ever a situation where Pandora just scratched the surface of it that if it’s about branding and letting people know who supports music that the entire enterprise could be flying in a different pattern through something invisible that maybe I just can’t see sound waves but isn’t it the most mysterious thing that of the things that can get me to lift a finger isn’t music the only thing
</p>
<p>“Play some Stone Temple Pilots.” Said Ze
</p>
<p>“Purple or Plush?” said Frank
</p>
<p>“Tiny Music … “
</p>
<p>Alright.
</p>
<p>Then Frank graces his fingers on the Z Plane and wed himself to “Tiny Music” and thought to himself if there was anything about people being people, it’s music.
</p>
<p>It just so happens that he was fully intent on doing what he always does.
It started to play and the most surprising thing has to do with lag and that it’s the instantaneousness of it and that he sat there sixteen inches from his computer monitor and stopped doing all of it.</p>

<p>His apartment was transported to circa 1999 Seattle and just like that he was somewhere else just lost in the arrogant notes of some people that were just melodic about their arrogance but he didn’t mind because it was music and there was a moment where he thought.
</p>
<p>| W o u l d I E v e r U N D E R S T A N D a n d |
</p>
<p>He just had this zoned out moment where he was just wishing there was something involving four hours he could do to really make certain that the mother fucking stone temple pilots would the fuck just motherfucking know someone was the fuck listening to their tracks and it just wasn’t there right now they just couldn’t possibly know that there would even be a pressure sensor associated with Spotify so that when he was just into it he could let it know how much he was into it by squeezing down on some kind of hacky sack or ping pong ball and that between 1 and 10,000 units of pressure he could just be letting it know how he feels about it by squeezing something while sitting here doing nothing but making certain something knew that it was being listened to and if the Pressure could just build and he could just squeeZe something
</p>
<p>“Hey Ze?” said Frank
</p>
<p>“Yeah.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Would you squeeZe something while listening to a song you liked if you knew it was important?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Yeah.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Wondering?” said Frank
</p>
<p>Alright so like he would just be sitting there on Spotify with a pressure sensitive hacky sack in his hand and like when Big Bang Baby came on he would just squeeZe as hard as his little human hand could muster and then when like Ricky Martin came on he would just throw it against the wall and just let Ricky Martin know to shut the fuck up and that whatever.
</p>

<p>Like if he could just let it know.
</p>

<h2>Chapter 6
</h2>
<p>Frank was involved in his own personal downward dog in the middle of his apartment. He knew he had too much stuff. Just too much. He knew he did. He knew it. He didn’t even want carpeting. He knew he wanted a wood floor. He knew he did. He knew it. He knew when it came to floor he wanted wood. He knew it. When it came to wood floors he knew he wanted wood. He was in the downward dog position and he was just at the point where he was transitioning to the upward dog position when she walked in.
</p>
<p>“Cha doin?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Yoga.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“K’s” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I can’t even do yoga when you are in the room even though I would love to be able to.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Y Not?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I’m not at that level yet. I’m not at the level where I can do yoga in my apartment with someone else in the room. I’m not. I can do yoga in a room with an instructor but I’m not at the level of my yoga where when someone else is in the room I can keep doing yoga. I can do yoga by myself alone and that’s the only way I can really do yoga.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“You don’t have to do yoga.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I know. Well I sort of have to. I know I don’t have to. Like I know. But I sort of do.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I don’t do yoga.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Aaagh. I know. You don’t do a lot of stuff.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Is there anything wrong with not doing a lot of stuff?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“No.” said Frank the opposite of sternly but just as confident. A very confident not stern statement of just that.
</p>
<p>“Can you get in trouble for doing a lot of stuff?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Yeah. If I am being honest. If you do a lot of stuff you can get in trouble.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I know. I know that a long time ago.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Well.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>Ze shook her head a little bit from side to side and it looked like she had the first thought she had had in several times and she sort of bended her neck and her head moved from side to side and she rolled her head around some and she sort of looked to the side and then she looked at Frank and then she lowered her body and did a single push up.
</p>
<p>“If you did one of those a day. You would do 365 a year. That’s not a small number.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>Frank’s eyes sort of reacted and that was all.
</p>
<h2>Chapter 7
</h2>
<p>Ze had her chiffon on. She was standing there looking in the mirror. She was just looking at herself. She was sort of noticing how she liked the color of the chiffon. It was the only dress she was ever given and she only wore it in front of the mirror. No one else knew that.
</p>
<p>Frank walked in and noticed her wearing the chiffon in front of the mirror and when she realiZed someone saw her wearing it. She habitually stopped looking in the mirror and started to pull her shoulder out of the dress and she started to disrobe. Frank sort of noticed her taking the dress off and he sort of pulled his head to the side and looked at her through the sides of his eyes.
</p>
<p>She looked over her shoulder at him.
</p>
<p>She wasn’t going to get naked but she knew he was going to see some skin.
</p>
<p>Frank sort of stood there and watched her.
</p>
<p>She knew she was trapped in that the closet she needed to get her clothing from was in the closet behind Frank and that she needed to ask him to move to get some clothing.
</p>
<p>She wasn’t happy today.
</p>
<p>Frank wasn’t happy either.
</p>
<p>She walked over to the closet with the chiffon folded over onto itself and her bra was exposed and she brushed Frank aside for a moment without touching him and she went through her closet and decided that out of the fourteen outfits she had that she was going to wear a pair of jeans and a t-shirt. She picked the most rock t-shirt that she could find and the jeans she treated as a project once with a knife. She knows exactly why she treats all of her jeans with a knife.
</p>
<p>Frank saw her going at a pair of jeans once with a knife and he didn’t want to know why. She just this one time she was all with knife and she was like the jeans bent her or something and she just went in on em.
</p>
<p>Frank saw her pull the jeans from the closet and she pulled her “1 Fuck Given and Only 1” T Shirt and she just knew she was going to go for a walk. She thought for a second that she felt a certain way when she went for a walk for no reason and cars were passing her on the side and she just it depended on what she was wearing but from time to time it occurred to her that she could at any time but to this day she is sort of proud she never did.
</p>
<p>Frank sort of didn’t know about that and he never asked her about most of what she was surprised no one ever asked her about and she really only talked about what she was asked about.
</p>
<h2>Chapter 6
</h2>
<p>Frank went into the bathroom and picked up his tooth brush and picked up some toothpaste and he did this. He put the tooth paste on his finger and put his finger to his teeth and put some toothpaste on his teeth. He kept his brush clean and shook his shoulders and went. Different.
</p>
<p>Ze saw him do it.
</p>
<p>She had this moment.
</p>
<p>“Frank!” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“What?” said Frank knowing da fuck she was talking about.
</p>
<p>“The right way?!” said Ze with her head forward and lowered and to the side with a look on her face like you know god damned good and well how to brush your teeth.
</p>
<p>Frank looked at her and didn’t say anything and just put some toothpaste on his tooth brush.
</p>
<h2>Chapter 7
</h2>
<p>“Frank.” Said Ze
</p>
<p>“What?” said Frank
</p>
<p>“When is the next show?” said Ze
</p>
<p>“Coming up.” Said Frank
</p>
<p>“Can I dance on stage?” said Ze
</p>
<p>Frank shook his head abruptly to the side.
</p>
<p>“I mean. Yeah. Ze. You can dance on stage.” Said Frank
</p>
<p>“Okay.” Said Ze
</p>
<p>Ze then walked up to Frank and kissed him on the check and then kissed him on the other check and then kissed him on the forehead and then kissed him on the chin and then kissed him lightly on the lips.
</p>
<p>Then she nodded her head and turn around and sat down in a chair.
</p>
<p>“Let’s get down to business.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“What?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Business. Let’s get down to it.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“You want to get down to business.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Yes. I want to get down to business.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I mean. I’m sitting here righting a song but we can get down to business.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Alright.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Are we down to business yet?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“We miiiight be down to business.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“We need to get down to business so that we can do some business.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“We’re down to business.” Said Ze
</p>
<p>“What do we do now.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Now that we are down to business? We look each other in the eyes.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Alright.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>Frank and Ze lock eyes. Ze flutters her eyelids ceremoniously and Frank flutters his eye lids. Ze warps her eyes around in a circle and Frank warps his eyes around in a circle in the opposite direction. Now that they are down to business they can play their eye games. It’s time for eye games.
</p>
<p>“Alright. I’m closing shop. “ said Frank.
</p>
<p>“No.” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Yep. I’m closing shop.” Said Frank who then closed his eyes.
</p>
<p>“Frank NO! Don’t close up shop.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I got to. I can’t afford the rent.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I’ll pay your rent. Just open shop back up.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I can’t pay my employees. I gotta close up shop.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I’ll make a big purchase.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Alright. Maybe I can open up shop.” Said Frank who opened up one eye.
</p>
<p>“I went to a lot of work. You should be able to open up the whole shop.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I don’t know one of my employees want’s a raise.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Alright. Here’s enough.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Alright.” Said Frank opening his other eye up.
</p>
<p>“I like when you are open for business.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Yeah. It’s not easy. I don’t get a lot of business.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I’m a good customer.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I pretty much work for you.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Mmmmm. Don’t say that.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Well. I don’t feel the need to work for myself. I don’t need much.” Sad Frank.
</p>
<p>“What do you need?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I don’t know. A couple clients.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Be honest. What is a client?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“A client?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Yes. What is a client. I might want one.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Oh.” Said Frank Raising his eyebrows fully.
</p>
<p>“A client is someone that needs something. (he pulls his mouth to the side) It just so happens I know my way around a pc and it just so happens I can code a website and it just so happens that I am hip to maybe how websites can be done now that there is more memory available. A client is someone that I have down on my ledger as in need of photographs or stories or video or some music that they put on their website. “ said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Oh.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Yeah. Like you make baskets AND you want a relationship with your customers so that they have more to talk about in regards to your basket weaving business and brand than you weave baskets or something and like I’m the guy that builds the stuff your clients can talk about for hours as opposed to the three seconds they would normally have available to talk about your basket weaving with. Like for another example. They are not a client of mine, but, coca cola. Right now all you can really say about coca cola is whether you like their soda or not and that’s about it but if I write a story for coca cola and put it on their website it increases the amount of conversation you can include their brand in. Like I could write a story about the history of soda in narrative fashion and conjure what was going through the minds of the men that invented coke 200 years ago and if I do it a certain way it seems as epic a moment in history as it is and now you have something you can talk about for a couple more minutes than what whether or not you like coke would provide.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“OH!” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Yeah.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Can I help?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Oh.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Well. You could write a story.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“About what?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Well. Who is your client? Just pick someone.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Hader Hardware.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Alright. Write a story about how you fixed your first faucet using the tools from Hader Hardware and make certain to include as many names of tools as you can and maybe how you gave the taxi driver that brought you there directions to the Hader Hardware from let’s say downtown Cincinnati where he picked you up.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Would you do it for me?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I mean sure.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Okay.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Moving on.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>Frank looked Ze in the eye.
</p>
<p>Ze looked Frank in the eye.
</p>
<p>Frank shrugged his shoulders and got down on the floor and did a push up and then got back in the chair.
</p>
<p>“What did you do that for?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Something you said.” Said Frank
</p>
<p>“Oh you mean about the push up a day.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Yeah.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“You listened to me.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“It was a good point.” Said Frank.
</p>
<h2>Chapter 8
</h2>
<p>Frank had his pencil out. The one he habitually left chew mark ins. He had some moleskin in his hands. He was zoning out letting the pencil scrawl across some lines and he was all up into the verse chorus verse and he was sort of writing his next song keeping his pencil alive. He had something down like
</p>

<p>:<br>
It was like they couldn’t see<br>
Even though I couldn’t hear<br>
And we drew each other near<br>
Just to experience the clear<br>
There was clarity<br>
And there was mud<br>
We don’t belong here<br>
And it’s too far to run<br>
:<br></p>

<p>He was sitting there trying to come up with his next line. He just needed one. He had a recording studio session coming up where he was going to be with the band and they were going to be being all Dead Pencil about being Dead Pencils and Frank. Dear God he had an entire album to write! Even though it wasn’t like that for him. He kept it cool and he knew the band depended on him to keep writing songs. He wasn’t really planning on using this as a song. He was just writing some library that MIGHT be used for a song.
</p>
<p>The band wouldn’t put up with him writing songs without them in the room. He had to write the songs while they were playing the music. The band let Frank know that he writes the songs. The lyrics anyways. They do the other stuff. Keeps the band balanced. They figure Frank’s the one that has to actually say the words so he has to do the writing in terms of what he wants to sing but they at least want to be in the room when it happens so that from time to time basically they can be like.
</p>

<p>“Cha Got so Far?” would say the band and he would, Frank, would be expected to reply with whatever he has at that point in the studio. The Dead Pencil’s man. They don’t fuck around. Frank let it’s be known that if he’s the lead singer they get their money’s worth. They walk into the studio with some instruments and some sheets of paper and they don’t stop until they have an album. They record once every three years and they just spend their tour money on the studio and they walk in with nothing and they just avoid sleep and all kinds of shit and just get it done. He’s got no problem writing and they don’t have a problem coming up with licks and it’s just we go in , we get it done , we get our master and then later they listen to the album until they have it all memoriZed and then they play the same bar they always play.
</p>
<p>Or something.
</p>
<p>Why did I write that?
</p>
<p>I don’t know.
</p>
<p>Anyways.
</p>
<p>Frank was sitting there writing something. Zoned out into the prose of this short.
</p>
<p>Frank was just penning some poetry.
</p>
<p>Ze walked in with a flute.
</p>
<p>Frank looked at Ze.
</p>
<p>“Da fuck?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I want to join the band.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“No.” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I have a flute.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>Frank’s body from the neck up reacted with a jerk at the thought. His entire upper situation jerked to the side at the thought of Ze joining the band.
</p>
<p>“No.” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Here I’ll play a song.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I mean.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Just listen.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>Flute Flute Flutey Flute Flute Flute Flute Flute Flute Floot FLOOT FLOOT flute.
</p>
<p>“There I played the Flute. I can be in the band.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Alright. You need to audition for the band. I thought you wanted to dance on stage?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I forgot about that.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“You can play the flute though.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Calculus is fucked up.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Whoagh! I never said it wasn’t.” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Fuck Calculus. I’m almost at three variables.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“You keep doing that. It’s why we have multiple rooms so that we don’t disrupt each other doing stuff.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“How is your music doing on iTunes?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Well enough that I am doing this full time.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“We should at least think of touring.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“No. Oh Hell No. No. The audience never has a reason to go on tour. Like right now people are touring to go see Britney Spears and she is comfortable putting her show on several nights a week. Fuck touring. I fucking hate it. B B King had it right. Find you a room, find you a bar, and just play your music. If it’s about shows it’s about shows and it’s not about where the shows are. All a tour is going to do is hem up the shows and then different sound people and when you saving up money it’s hard to bring visuals on tour and you get that venue that is down for some Processing.org lighting and visuals and you can’t really customiZe a road show sort of not the way you can a standing gig and then you gotta be living hard to live on the road and we talked about it the band and me and we’re here. We have these tools and the website has the promoter that is saying hi to people on the internet and we have our venue and it’s always going to be our venue and basically our plans are to keep tricking it out and parlaying the door into our drink tab and selling swag and just partnering up with our friends and getting something really cozy going on that doesn’t involve wheels and oil and 60 miles per hour and highways and random people in random places and maybe 100 years ago you had to tour but we don’t I just recogniZe.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“You don’t like to tour?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I mean. You don’t like to stay at home. I just don’t act like it should be arbitrary. If a city ever asked us to play and was cool about it I would consider it but I feel like I have to be invited and that there is a level of barging in on some people to just show up and randomly be all impressing the chicks in another city and giving the men of another city some random people to compete with on some random night and the touring band always looks more impressive than the local bands and why give the local bands a run for the women and the money and the all of it when we can just be the local band here and be like magnets attracting energy instead of wasting it and getting tired and going around and like if we were invited and it was serious and they knew how our stage was set up and we had a similar stage set up and they had a guy that could do the Processing.org work and we just play better at home. If we were invited.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Okay.” Said Ze thinking of the fact that she might call some people and see if she can get him an invite if it’s just about an invite and she sort of wants to see the Grand Canyon.
</p>
<p>“You play the flute nicely.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I do.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“So like. You don’t mind not having a nine to five situation?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I don’t mind an open schedule. It’s not as easy as I thought it would be. It’s not. I am pretty good at keeping busy though and setting lots of small goals for myself. I don’t mind.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I will never understand why I have to go through CD Baby to get on iTunes. Like there is a 3rd party involved and I don’t know why. Glad I know how to fill out forms though.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Do you get fan mail?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Fan mail? I have it all collated on a Buddy Press site. Yeah the Dead Pencil’s got fans. We got a say in some PHD thesis paper’s too. Some stuff we talk about on our forum ends up in front of University Professors. Just legit shit. Like the one guy did his Doctor’s Thesis on what the H in P.H.D. stands for, he’s filling out paper work for his accredits right now. Everyone in the Dead Pencil’s has their Graduate Degree. You’ll meet the band soon enough.” Said Frank.
</p>

<p>“I’d like to. It’s not like I want it to just be you and me this entire eternity. We don’t have to be cultists about each other.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Well here.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“What?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Pull up http://www.deadpencil.com” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“No.” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Alright. I was going to set you up with an account.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I don’t want an account. I want to meet the band.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Aight.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>Frank pulls up his iPhone and taps a button.
</p>
<p>“You guys rehearsing?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“We were.” Said Al.
</p>
<p>“Well, I met this chick at the Comet the other night. We been together since. We all up into each other’s worlds and she moved in. She wants to meet some people.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“She there?” said Al.
</p>
<p>“She’s right here.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Put her on FaceTime and let me look at her.” Said Al.
</p>
<p>“Alright Ze, this is an Al. He’s a lead guitarist. He just so happens to not be aware of any music signature he hasn’t signed and he beat his guitar. It’s sort of his bitch now.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“AAAAL!” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“What’s your name?” said Al.
</p>
<p>“Ze.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“You seem nice. Be careful with Frank. He’s not to be toyed with.” Said Al.
</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Just don’t be a bitch to him.” Said Al.
</p>
<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Ze.
</p>
<p>“Yeah.” Said Al.
</p>
<p>Ze looked over at Frank.
</p>
<p>“Then don’t give me a reason to be a bitch!” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I didn’t say it but I try to be allergic to giving you those reasons. I can’t handle bitches.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Okay. Well. Don’t be an asshole. I hate those things.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“She seems fine.” Said Al.
</p>
<p>“Oh she is.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>Ze blushed.
</p>
<p>“Hey. You got any vocals on Sound Cloud right now?” said Al.
</p>
<p>“Not right now. But I got my mic set up. I got some lyrics set up.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“We got our programmer working on some visuals that just bob and weave with the music. It’s the only way to explain it. We want the audience staring at the ceiling mostly. It’s where we are going to place the visuals. We want the audience looking up.” Said Al.
</p>
<p>“Cool. Yeah. There is a lot of work on the walls that disrupt the visuals but yeah, that ceiling would be clear wouldn’t it.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“You know it.” Said Al.
</p>
<p>“Alright. Well. She wanted to meet the band.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Everyone else is out right now. It’s just me in the studio.” Said Al.
</p>
<p>“Ze, you want to know anything about me? This is Al, he’s known me a long time.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Anything I should know about Frank?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“He’s brilliant.” Said Al.
</p>
<p>Ze sort of ruggered her head back and forth and looked at Frank like she wanted to know something about how all of this is going a certain way.
</p>
<p>“Hey. Well. I wrote that code that one time. You said it was brilliant. It made sense to me.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Alright. Well. Thank you for the comprehensive comments on it. Those help.” Said Al.
</p>
<p>“Anytime.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>Ze was sitting in class. She was in the front row. She had her hand raised. There were two other people with their hands raised. The Professor was explaining programmatic functions. Ze had a questions.
</p>
<p>“Ze.” Said Professor Unthchild.
</p>
<p>“So, it’s the functions where the meat of the program happens? Like. If I really know what I am doing I am using functions? said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Well, it helps to keep things more orderly. Depending on the scope of your program, you want functions. You can’t write an object without knowledge of functions. I mean. Keep paying attention and you’ll see this all make sense.” Said Professor Unthchild.
</p>
<p>“Alright.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Yes.” Said Professor Unthchild.
</p>
<p>“How does this all equate to a program though? One of those things that I click a mouse on and stuff happens?” said Random Excelsior Student.
</p>
<p>“Well. I’ll put it like this to see if I can put that other hand down before I have to listen to the sounds it wants to make. This is a grammar class. The entire scope of this entire course is to teach you programmatic grammar. That’s why the projects are simple and that’s why you might think you are above the work I am prescribing. This is grammar. Similar to grammar school your youth. Right now I am certain all of you could write a book if you wanted to but you couldn’t ten years ago when you didn’t know grammar. Right now I am certain you want to write a program. You can’t though. You don’t know the grammar. So keep paying attention and noticing that I am showing you the moves you would use to write a program with and the options you have as a programmer but these are all general studies that are applicable to a number of situations, to all of the situations. You need these grammar lessons so that you can execute a basic functioning program. I’ll stop here.” Said Professor Unthchild.
</p>

<p>The other hand went down.
</p>
<p>“Alright. Now I can go back to professing.” Said Professor Unthchild.
</p>
<p>“Please remember. Listen. Read. Do the work. Of course you are confused. You didn’t do the reading.” Said Professor Unthchild.
</p>
<p>Ze sat there in the front row. She wasn’t taking notes. She was zoned out. Letting it all sink in. She didn’t do the reading. Last time she’s going to let that happen. She looked up at the clock. Five minutes left. She was thinking about how Frank needed a Processing.org guy to go with the Processing.org guy the Dead Pencil’s already had.
</p>
<p>She wanted that. She wanted to write some clever code that would be exhibition worthy and she could see how that would be useful to a band. Exhibitionistic programming sounds cool. No. She was thinking to herself. She never heard of it before she stepped into the University. Money worth getting all of it she is she thought to herself.
</p>
<p>“You can leave now.” Said Professor Unthchild.
</p>
<p>Ze. Doesn’t even have a bag with her. She just has herself. She feels free. She gets up and walks out into the hallway. There are a several hundred lockers adorning the walls. She just wonders why they are there. The same thing she wonders every time she sees them.
</p>
<p>Ze makes a tight turn down a hall way and makes a spiral pattern down a set of stair cases. She gets to the outside and she notices that there are thousands of them. The people. The people in thousands are milling around and everyone is out of their classes and she has this moment where she just thinks we’re all a little smarter now than we were an hour ago. She just had a thought.
</p>
<p>Ze pulls out her iPhone. She wants a panoramic photograph. She pulls up PanoRama and clicks the app. She stands there and gets it lined up. She pushes down on the button. She swivels to the side slowly to get the full panorama aaaaaaand there’s an error. She tilted it too much.
</p>
<p>She gave it one chance. Oh well. She decides she will settle for a tilt shift photograph. She pulls up Tilty and gives it a click. She clicks the shot. It’s her favorite filter. She uploads it to Facebook and now she has another photograph in her photograph folder.
</p>
<p>Ze shrugs her shoulders. She’s not sure how often most people take Tilt Shift photographs and she certainly doesn’t know who’s good at panning for a panoramic photograph she just knows she’s not. It’s too touchy. She doesn’t feel like there is anything wrong with her or the software. She figures she needs a tripod to get the panorama she desires of something.
</p>
<p>Alright. So she starts walking.
</p>
<p>She sees Frank passing out flyers from a distance. She just stops and notices for a seconds worth of seconds and she starts to watch him. Down the hill and across the street Frank has what appears to be about three hundred flyers and he is putting them in the mail boxes of Greek Fraternity and Sorority mail boxes. He is walking up a drive way and placing them in the mail box. He knocks on the door and walks away. He makes his way back to the sidewalk and he just look up and he sees her.
</p>
<p>There is Frank some 500 yards away passing out flyers and he takes a second and raises his hand in the air and waves.
</p>
<p>Ze actually blushes.
</p>
<p>Frank standing there 500 yards away Ze can barely make out what he is doing.
</p>
<p>He picked up a sheet of paper and he started to fold it. He placed the other pages on the ground and he started to do something. She doesn’t know what. Until the last minute.
</p>
<p>He made a paper air plane and he threw it forward.
</p>
<p>Ze doesn’t know when the last time she saw a paper air plane was but having seen this one made her want to go play with him.
</p>
<p>Ze bobs her head from side to side for a beat and starts to make her way down the grassy knoll.
</p>
<p>Frank picks up the sheets of paper that are flyers on the ground and he starts to hand them out to people that are passing on the walk. He is making certain to let everyone know where the Dead Pencil’s put on their shows. What day they perform every week. He just does this basically three days a week.
</p>
<p>Ze walks up to his side.
</p>
<p>“FRANK!” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“ZE!” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Gimme some.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>Frank hands Ze some flyers and something magical happens. Frank stone cold watches Ze get her fairy on and she sprites from person to person filled with glee to make certain to see the Dead Pencil’s. She is the flyer fairy from Narnia spriting from person to person smiling like it’s the only thing she knows how to do and making certain everyone has a flyer.
</p>
<p>“Yeah but when is the Pencil’s new album coming out?” said Someone.
</p>
<p>“Frank, you have a question.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Wait. Whoah! Frank!” said the man.
</p>
<p>“Yeah man. What up?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I was just wondering when the new Pencil’s album is coming out?” said the man.
</p>
<p>“Hey man. We are going into the studio next week. You want to come hang out with us?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“FUCK YEAH!” said the man.
</p>
<p>“Alright well. Give me your email address and I’ll send you an invite. It’s an open studio session. Maybe you can do a skit or something and end up on the record.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“What’s the name of the Album?” said the Man.
</p>
<p>“Right now it’s ‘Saturated Sound Clouds’ or something like that.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Yeah my email addy is themanonthestreet@outlook.com .” said the man.
</p>
<p>“Alright cool , one minute. I didn’t have it set up. “ said Frank.
</p>
<p>Frank pulls up his voice recorder app on his iPhone and taps the record button.
</p>
<p>“Alright man it’s on you. Go ahead and spell out your email addy for the mic.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“T_H_E_M_A_N_O_N_T_H_E_S_T_R_E_E_T_@_O_U_T_L_O_O_K_._C_O_M_ “ said the man.
</p>
<p>“Alright. The Man on The Street @ Outlook. I gotchu. Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Yeah.” Said the Man.
</p>
<p>“We’re not really selling anything but T-Shirt’s anymore and maybe some other stuff like art and books and the such but like. We’re going into the studio mostly just to do it and we’re planning on getting another 75 to 100 iTunes Tracks. Just quick shit. Like just moments or something. Just like pieces of songs and some skits and we are going all Napsack on it. Just getting knapsack.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Knapsack.” Said the man.
</p>
<p>“Yeah like we keep trying to figure out what to name the thing. We went from the Conchord Grape Vine to now we are working with Knapsack. We gotta figure out what to name that thing.”said Frank.
</p>
<p>“You mean the internet?” said the man.
</p>
<p>“Fuck yeah!. The Internet is nothing to name something.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I never really thought about it.” Said the man.
</p>
<p>“You think of all kinds of shit when you got a certain kind of time on your hands. It’s not for everyone. Dear God I can’t possibly be expected to have a normal thought. That’s why my songs are all left field concepts.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Ay, alright, well I gotta go. I’ll see you in the studio.” Said the man.
</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you.” Said the man.
</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you. “ said Ze.
</p>
<p>Ze started scampering her fairy dust onto passerby like all she knew how to do was smile and she was putting flyers in everyone’s hands.
</p>
<p>It was like two thirteen in the a.m. and Frank was on Reddit just pouring over the links. He did this quite often. He was leaving a comment in regards to a dream he had the night before. He wanted someone to know about his dream so badly that he was filling out a form to let anyone that cared know. He was listening to Carly Rae Jepsen while he was doing it writing about the dream he had with Katy Perry in it where she tried to bite him with her vampire teeth because she wanted to kill him, they weren’t real vampire teeth, they were fake. Katy Perry almost killed him in his dream similar to how he partied with her from time to time in his dreams at various parties in a world where he was certain there was more going on than here in this world where we were leaving our brains on a wall and there was a world where it wasn’t about the wall and Carly Rae Jepsen was talking about how she really liked someone and he was listening to the pop music while he was on Reddit filling out some forms and then she walked in.
</p>
<p>“Frank!” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“What?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Can we stop listening to Carly Rae Jepsen?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“What do you want to listen to?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“What about Justin Bieber?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“What about the Sleep Playlist?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“What about Kaki King?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“We can listen to the Kaki King.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Whatcha doin?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I’m on Reddit writing about how I had a dream of Katy Perry and she tried to bite me.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Don’t dream of Katy Perry.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I didn’t have a choice. She just showed up and tried to fuck me up.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“She would never do that.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“She might. She might not like me.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I am certain Katy Perry would not hate you.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“She might. She might not like my music.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Me. Frank. Meesy. Don’t worry about Katy Perry. Worry about me. K.” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Alright Ze. Alright. I’ll leave Katy Perry alone. She has some new perfume.” Said Frank.</p>

<p>“FRANK!” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“What?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Katy Perry lives in Los Angeles. You live in Hamilton County.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I know. Life. Dreams. Fantasies. Who do you dream about?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Justin Bieber. But I don’t write about my dreams on the wall.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“It’s a special wall. It’s more like graffiti really. Like I feel like a painter.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Alright. Do you want some toast?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“How about I make you some toast?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“No. I want to make the toast.” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Alright you make the toast.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>So Ze walked over to the bread and pulled out four loaves. She walked over to the toaster and put in four pieces of toast. She liked toast.
</p>
<p>“I like the word toast.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I do too.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“When was the last time we got to that next level Frank?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I know, right.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“You want to get to that next level?” asked Ze.
</p>
<p>“Oh that’s a special question.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“What have you been thinking about?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Me. This thing mostly. This box. This box that is connected to the other boxes. I started on Prodigy when I was a kid and now it’s this. It’s filled with files. I have some files on it. I keep staring at it and it keeps making me feel like I am programming reality. Like I am in this band right. I also write. I met you recently and it’s like it doesn’t exist anymore. Like when I am alone in this apartment it’s everything. It’s an entertainment center but like when you are here. I do very little on it. Like I would rather lay in bed with you. There is a part of me that feels like it’s to be used when you are alone and if someone else is around talk to them. Put the information you learned on this machine to good use and talk to someone.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I have a Twitter Account.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“How do you feel about Twitter?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Like a lot of it isn’t real. No one ever writes back but I write a lot of blue check marked people. I feel like writing someone that has a television show is awesome. I don’t know what to write to someone whose personality I don’t know much about. I tried to write a stranger who didn’t have a show or an album or a book or anything that speaks of personality and I didn’t know what to say other than HI!” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I know what you mean. Like I showed up on this planet. I don’t know what I was doing before I got here. At all. I assume nothing because to assume otherwise is absurd but I’m here. There is this box. It has alright two weeks ago before we met I would write super models and pop stars that were women. I thought maybe in my loneliness a pop diva would write me back on Twitter and I would feel less alone it never happened. I assume it has to do with my check mark status or my cheque status or just because it’s not a thing yet. You know? It hasn’t happened yet that story of the person that tweeted someone and they met and they went to a concert together or something. We’re not there yet. I wrote Saul Williams too and offered to mail him some of his books. He didn’t respond either. I don’t exist to the people that I most want to exist to. When I was a kid I thought all of the famous people have all of the famous people’s telephone numbers and they are all best friends. Now I know that’s not true.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“How alone were you before we met? I would have thought you had enough friends that loneliness wouldn’t be something you experienced?” asked Ze.
</p>

<p>“I always feel lonely. Even on stage with the band. I just always feel lonely. You have cheered me up recently what these last two three weeks? I mean … “ said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Alright stop.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“You’re not lonely anymore. You know what Katy Perry won’t do with you and that Carley Rae Jepsen is too young for. They won’t model for you. Right now in this moment. They are not here. They are off in some wilderness of the human population and they are performing for millions of people and I am right here with you right now. Look at my face. I take good care of it. Look at my hips and my chest and my legs and my arms and my back. “ said Ze turning in a circle.
</p>

<p>“I know I am not lonely when I am with you. I’m lonely because I have this computer.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“See how long you can go with it turned off.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“This thing. I think about that. It has lights and words and photographs and audio and video and it makes sound. “ said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I’m all of that and I am right here. Watch this.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>Ze took her shirt off she was standing there with her cups filled and she was standing there.
</p>
<p>Frank reached down and turned the computer off.
</p>
<p>Frank turned the monitor off.
</p>
<p>Ze was standing there.
</p>
<p>“Bend over.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>Ze bent over.
</p>
<p>Frank got up out of his seat and walked over and caressed her back and he reached back and smacked her on the ass.
</p>
<p>“Frank!” said Ze playfully.
</p>
<p>“Alright now let me see an angle.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>Frank went and got a camera and he was spending time here with Ze.
</p>
<h2>Chapter 9
</h2>
<p>It was one of those apartments that didn’t have a bed. It had about sixteen pillows of various siZes and colors but it didn’t have a bed. It had about eight blankets too. Walking into the bedroom there was just scattered around it pillows and blankets. It was a morning. Ze was coupled up with Frank and Frank was coupled up with Ze. They were sort of just laying there just laying there. Ze was awake and Frank was a awake and the color of the sky was sun kissed and there were some aura’s floating in through the lattices of the blinds and they were just laying there. Frank was sort of staring into Ze’s eyes and Ze was sort of staring into Frank’s eyes. They were having a conversation with their eye lids. Ze would blink three times and Frank would blink four times and then Ze would blink twice and Frank would blink twice. They were having that one conversation that they never thought they would have. Just eyelids and staring into each other’s eyes. It was one of those mornings.
</p>
<p>“It didn’t take much effort for me to move in.” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“You skip a lot of your classes at school.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Well, just this quarter something happened in my life.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I mean, what?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“You.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“You happened to me too, Ze.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Why did I come home with you?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I don’t know. You just sort of started following me.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“No. You invited me here.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I don’t remember that.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Well, I am making it true. No kind of girl just follows a boy back to his place, so, you invited me. There. I don’t want any kids thinking I am not the lady I want the kids to believe I am. So. You invited me.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“What did I say again, for the kids?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Don’t do that. Just come up with something.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“That’s what I thought.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Shut up.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>Frank reached out and pulled some of Ze’s hair lightly. He just gave one of her long bangs a light tug.
</p>
<p>“Ow.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>Ze reached out and pulled some of Frank’s hair.
</p>
<p>“Ow.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“We’re even. Don’t give me another unbalanced equation or I’ll balance that equation whether you like it or not.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Alright. Goddamn. Want to hear a poem?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Yes.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Alright. Off the top of the dome. Off the top of the dome.” Said Frank softly.
</p>
<p>“Stop. Just the poem please.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Off the top of the dome.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“The poem.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“<br>
roses are red<br>
I wish you knew<br>
we can do anything<br>
here is a clue<br>
“<br>
 said Frank who then proceeded to reach under the blanket and take Ze’s hand in his own.</p>

<p>“OH!” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Yeah. We can do anything Ze.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>Frank then proceeded to sit up and he placed his body next to Ze’s.
</p>
<p>“Lay on your stomach.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>Ze proceeded to quietly lay over on her stomach.
</p>
<p>Frank then took his hands and pressed in firmly at her shoulders and pulled his hands down directly while pressing firmly towards the base of her spine. He then dug his thumbs firmly into the backs of her thighs and kept pulling down until he got to the backs of her knees.
</p>
<p>He then moved his hands back up from her knees up her thighs and across her buttocks which he gave a firm squeeZe to and then he pushed his hands into her back that he moved up the small of her back and he took one of his thumbs and drew it up her spine while pressing down until he got up to her neck where he took his hands and started to rub her shoulders in a deep throbbing way that involved pushing his index fingers into his thumbs with four pounds of flesh between his fingers where he was making certain to keep the muscles of her neck in between his fingers and he was massaging her neck muscles firmly.
</p>
<p>“Frank.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“What’s up?” said Frank softly.
</p>
<p>“You did ask me to come here.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Alright Ze. I was just surprised you didn’t mind coming to this apartment.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“When are you going to get a bed?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I wasn’t planning on it.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“We need a bed.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Well. I’ll see about getting a bed.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“You don’t mind me living here?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“No. I don’t mind you living here Ze.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I never lived with a boy before.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“We do stuff like this when we live with a girl.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>He leaned down and while massaging her back he kissed the back of her neck.
</p>
<p>“Oh Frank.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Yeah. It’s just you and me right now.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you talk to the girl at the other side of the bar. Why did we end up talking?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Because you were the only person at the bar that laughed and I heard your laugh and I wanted to meet the person that made that sound.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I laugh.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I know. I like it when you laugh.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>Frank was still massaging Ze’s neck muscles when he reached forward and grabbed her hair and gave it a tug. Her head sort of came back a bit. He legit pulled her hair a bit.
</p>
<p>“Hey.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I know.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>Frank then pierced his fingers together and used both hands to give her neck muscles a quick sharp pinch. Then he picked something up from the floor. He picked up a small quarter. He had a George Washington in his hands and gripped it tightly and he pulled the quarter down Ze’s spine. He got to the base of her spine and then he pulled it back up the opposite direction. He was using a single coin’s side in his hand to pull pressure up the base of Ze’s spine to between her shoulder blades and then back down to the base of her spine.
</p>
<p>“Frank.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“What?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Who are you?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Me?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Yes.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I’m a guy. I’m in a band named the Dead Pencil’s. I’m the lead singer and I perform for crowds. I like the Comet. I write stories. I graduated from school. I’ve been some places. I have seen some things. I have been in some trouble. I’m sort of surprised to be alive.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“SURPRISED TO BE ALIVE!” sad Ze sort of loudly.
</p>
<p>“Yes.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“What do you mean you almost died?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“This one time. Well a couple times but I don’t know. I assume I am not dead. I might be. I always hold that out. That this is what death is like. It wouldn’t surprise me. This might be the after life. I have dreams. So. I don’t mind this. I think about stuff.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“No. Frank. This is life.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Okay.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“What do you mean this might be the afterlife we can walk around and dance and sing and everything?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I imagine there are some really smart people somewhere that take care of everyone and want to keep everyone somewhere. I imagine there are some people in charge of it.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Like , we , don’t have anything to worry about?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Quite the opposite actually. To me. Quite the opposite. I am always worried about a lot of stuff. Things I see. Stuff. I have a lot of fears I have never heard expressed by anyone else.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Like what?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“No. I’ll keep my as I understand it unique thoughts to myself. I’m not trying to share my fears of something that … I keep certain thoughts to myself Ze.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>Frank had moved down to Ze’s calves. He was kneading them. He gave them a solid thirty seconds of kneading and then he took both of his hands and grasped a foot of Ze and he started to massage it’s muscle. He was massaging the muscle of Ze’s foot.
</p>
<p>“Do you like giving me massages?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I enjoy giving pleasure more than receiving it. Yes. The thought that I can produce pleasure gives me more pleasure than receiving it. I’m not ticklish. “ said Frank.
</p>
<p>“You like to give more than receive?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Yeah.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Mmmmm.” Said Ze sticking our her lower lip and holding it there.
</p>
<p>“You are frustrating Frank.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“No.” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“What do you like?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I like cups of coffee and writing stories.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“No. I mean what do you like?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“It has occurred to me that if you are producing pleasure while I am producing pleasure that we can do that for a while and we might not want to stop but we might get exhausted.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I don’t know a lot about giving pleasure.” Said Ze.
</p>

<p>“You can use your mouth or your hands or we can wrestle or we can bite or we can pull hair or we can throw our hands into each other, it’s something called, writhing, sex is what you see on video tapes and dvd’s for the most part but writhing is what really lasts all night, just becoming exhausted exploring each other’s body. Oil. Soap. Lotion. It’s the one thing that is totally up to you and when it builds to a certain point you are expressing yourself into my body and I am expressing myself into your body and we are having a conversation that does not have to end until our bodies physically cannot keep communicating.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>Ze flipped over.
</p>
<p>Frank flipped her back over.
</p>
<p>“Not now.” Said Frank.
</p>
<h2>Chapter 10
</h2>
<p>“Ze.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Frank!” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Zoe.” Said Nick.
</p>
<p>“Nick.” Said Zoe.
</p>
<p>“I did say Canada could have the Great Lakes.” Said nick.
</p>
<p>“Maybe we just want you … — … you.” Said Zoe.
</p>
<p>Frank was high. He was high on some marijuana. Marijuana. That sticky green enunciated aspect of nature that grows and when burned releases a perfume of intoxication that is like wine except you can drive when you are experiencing it. It’s the kind of high that releases endorphins and dolphins in the system and it gravitates through the cerebellum and makes someone think they are washing themselves in lotion when they are just sitting there trying to understand why the color blue looks different than the color red and wants a real reason that isn’t complicated.
</p>
<p>Ze was laying on the floor staring at the ceiling wondering why unicorns only had one horn.
</p>
<p>Frank looked over at Ze because he was laying on the floor to and he asked her if she wanted to hit it.
</p>
<p>“Yeah.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>Frank Fed Exed the blunt to Ze.
</p>
<p>Ze was sitting there trying to understand the color purple and then she hit it. She took a deep inhalation and she intoked the experience and she just …
</p>
<p>There was a knock at the door.
</p>
<p>“Yo!” said the Door.
</p>
<p>“YO?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“YO!” said the Door.
</p>
<p>“Alright.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Whosis?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>The door opened and there stood a crew.
</p>
<p>“Yo it’s a crew.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Damn right it’s a crew.” Said Dave.
</p>
<p>“Whatup? Yo come in. Sit down. Hit this. Chill with us.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Cool” said Dave.
</p>
<p>Dave, Sebastian and Jane walked in and took their places in a seating arrangement in the apartment. It was like a departure from reality when Dave shows up. He has been known to bring with him Salvia or DMT and it’s a regulation regulatory meeting to see what is going on with the band. The Dead Pencil’s have a show coming up and Frank needs to meet with his band. It’s like been some time and they have a rehearsal coming up and they need to get ready for the Southgate House and it’s a big show.
</p>
<p>“So like … “ said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Yeah.” Said Dave.
</p>
<p>“Hi!” said Jane to Ze.
</p>
<p>“You have nice socks.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I do.” Said Jane.
</p>
<p>“Yes.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>Dave and Sebastian and Frank are like in the cypher getting their minds straight as they are preparing themselves for a conversation. Something that will lead to understanding and insight into what to do next. Frank is the lead singer so he has a lot of say in this and these proceedings. Sebastian is interested in finding out if he’s still in the band and Dave is just running infantry trying to make certain the show goes off without a hitch.
</p>
<p>Frank pulls some kush from the pantry and starts to break some up.
</p>
<p>“We got the Southgate House.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Like we need to rehearse.” Said Dave.
</p>
<p>“We do.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“We need to rehearse more often than we need to rehearse. We have a tour to think about too.” Said Dave.
</p>
<p>“We can do a special tour. We can tour to Columbus and then come back to Cincinnati and then go to Indianapolis and then back to Cincinnati and then Toledo and then Cincinnati and we can do a cartwheel.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“That’s manageable. I’m still in the band right?” said Sebastian.
</p>
<p>“Sebastian.” Said Frank walking over and holding Sebastians head between his hands and staring him in the face.
</p>
<p>“You are in the band.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Alright cool. I’ve just never been in a band before.” Said Sebastian.
</p>
<p>“You should have been in a band a long time ago. You have ridiculous skills on the Drums.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I mean.” Said Sebastian.
</p>
<p>“It’s nothing to be in a band with you. You make it easy.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>There was the blunt being passed. Everyone was taking their time sitting back and getting their chill on. It was high tension but it was low groove. It was the band moment that was the essential element of getting together.
</p>
<h2>Chapter 10</h2>

<p>The Situation
</p>
<p>Frank was sitting on the back of the couch with legs on the cushions. Ze was laying on the floor.
</p>
<p>“We need to do something!” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“We are doing something.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“No. I mean something.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Like what?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Like make a television show.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“We have YouTube.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“No. That’s not television. We need to do something on television.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“What if we made a movie?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Movies are boring and no.” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Television?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Yes. Television.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Alright. Let me make a phone call.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“WHAT?!” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I said let me make a phone call you want a television show don’t you?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“NO! Not that fast. I want one but I don’t want one that fast.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>Ze got up and put the phone down and kissed Frank on the forehead.
</p>
<p>“How fast do you want one?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Medium speed. First we need to come up with a script. I need a costume.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“The script is easy.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“For you. It’s hard for me to come up with a script.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Alright what about the costume. Let’s do something easy first.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Northgate has costumes.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Alright let’s go to Northgate.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I fucking hate waiting for the bus.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Then let’s take a taxi.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“OO OO Let’s just go for a ride.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“You mean a ride? Like just drive around?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Yeah.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Well for that let me call a friend of mine. I got a friend that might be down to ride. I thought there was a purpose to this.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Why does there need to be a purpose?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Well if we have purpose we can figure out what to do.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Okay. I just want to go for a ride.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Would you mind if I call Mike?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“No.” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“He’s got a Mazda 626 that is fine to ride in.” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Can I call him?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Uh. Yeah. You can call him.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I want to talk to Mike.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>Frank hands Ze the phone. He dials in Mike’s number first and just hands it to her.
</p>
<p>“Mike!” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Is this Ze.” Said Mike over the phone.
</p>
<p>“This is Ze.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Why are we talking.” Said Mike.
</p>
<p>“Because.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I need more than because.” Said Mike.
</p>
<p>“I want to go for a ride. Frank said you had a car.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“You mean like go party wagonning?” said Mike.
</p>
<p>“Yeah. Party Wagon.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Does Frank still have the weed?” said Mike.
</p>
<p>“Frank do you have the weed?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Yo Mike I Got the Weed!” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Then we good.” Said Mike.
</p>
<p>“Mike said we’re good.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“We are.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“What you doing Mike right now?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Watching the Presidential Debates. They don’t seem like they are going to kill us.” Said Mike.
</p>
<p>“Cool.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“You want me to slide through.” Said Mike.
</p>
<p>“He wants to know if he should slide through?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Tell him to slide through and we can go on a party wagon.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Frank said you should slide through.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Alright, cool.” Said Mike.
</p>
<p>Mike turned off the television. He picked up his shoes and docked them onto his feet. Then he took off his T-Shirt and put on his smooth silk one because, well, party wagon. He picked up the phone.
</p>
<p>Dialed 555-4444.
</p>
<p>“Hello.” Said Janet.
</p>
<p>“Janet?” said Mike.
</p>
<p>“Miiiiiiiike you called!” said Janet.
</p>
<p>“Yeah. You want to go out with Frank and Ze.” Said Mike.
</p>
<p>“What we gonna do?” said Janet.
</p>
<p>“Drive around and smoke weed maybe work our way out to the country andpark and sit and chill.” Said Mike.
</p>
<p>“Sounds fun.” Said Janet.
</p>
<p>“Cool I’ll come swoop you after I pick up Frank and Ze so you have time to get ready.” Said Mike.
</p>
<p>“You’re leaving right now?” said Janet.
</p>
<p>“Yeah.” Said Mike.
</p>
<p>“I’ll wear a dress.” Said Janet.
</p>
<p>“Cool.” Said Mike.
</p>
<p>“Alright, so I’ll see you in how much time?” said Janet.
</p>
<p>“Like thirty minutes.” Said Mike.
</p>
<p>“Alright. I’ll put my make-up on in the car.” Said Janet.
</p>
<p>“Cool.” Said Mike.
</p>
<p>“Alright see you in a few. Thanks for thinking of me.” Said Janet.
</p>
<p>“I always think of you before a party.” Said Mike.
</p>
<p>“Stop.” Said Janet smiling.
</p>
<p>“Alright.” Said Mike.
</p>
<p>“Bye.” Said Janet.
</p>
<p>Mike picked up his keys and headed out to the Mazda. He adjusted his beanie and picked up his favorite pack of gum. He was good. He walked out the door and locked it up.
</p>
<p>Frank was looking around his spot for his weed spot. He had his kush kept comfortable around here. Wondered if Ze moved it. He always kept in the same place. Hold on. He just found it. It’s in the other place that is always the same place. He has two places that he always keeps the one thing in. It was in the other place. Personal weed. Something that is like green wine. You can drink a pint of wine, like Shiraz yellowtail or something, or you can smoke some weed. He never had much never more than a couple joint’s worth. He kept it small and to himself.
</p>
<p>Ze looked at Frank.
</p>
<p>“Can I roll one?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“No.” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Why?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Because you can’t roll.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“But how am I going to learn?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“By buying your own weed. This here is special weed. It’s potent.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“What’s it called?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“That you would ask. It’s called Angel Hairs because after smoking this you are likely to see an angel descend from the sky. It’s sort of hallucinogenic.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Cool.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Yeah I need to see visions. Reality is always just a bit too flat for me.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Hey! There’s Mike.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Let’s go.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>Frank and Ze get out of the apartment and make their way to the parking lot. Mike opens the back door for them because he nice like that. Frank and Ze get into the car.
</p>
<p>“Here.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Oh I get to light it?” said Mike.
</p>
<p>“For real.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Cool. We gotta go pick up Janet then we can head out to Winton Woods.” Said Mike.
</p>
<p>“Man I ain been to Winton, in forever.” Said Frank.</p>

<p>“They used to have a swing set.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Yeah it used to be different.” Said Mike.
</p>
<p>Mike lights the J and starts to get into it. He never really ever gets that high. Sort of bothers him that he is basically immune to weed. Frank not so much. He seems sensitive to it. Ze. No one can tell.
</p>
<p>Ze has the joint passed to her and she takes a big inhale.
</p>
<p>“It tastes great.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“It’s not frosted flakes honey.” Said Mike.
</p>
<p>“For real Ze calm down.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Shut Up!” said Ze.
</p>
<p>Ze leans over onto Frank’s shoulder and she passes the joint to Frank.
</p>
<p>Frank is just letting the smoke drift into his lungs. He has his girl on his shoulder his man on the wheel and it’s one of those last minute parties that everyone loves. Bout to hit up Winton Woods lookin like he just looking out the window letting Ze rest on his arm. Just being high just being like this the real. Just being like all up in the Mazda like who else is doing this like this the world we live in and Mike at the Wheel. Like the world is just revolving around us and Frank is just painting pictures for his mind to absorb and this weed right here. It’s the kind of weed that shares itself with you like the weed is conscious and when it’s burning it’s lighting up your nerve endings when you let the THC hit your lungs it’s like a carrot cake that has a girl scout cookie wrapped up inside of it and it’s like nothing you ever saw before.
</p>
<p>“Alright that’s my girl.” Said Mike.
</p>
<p>“She’s pretty.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Yeah she is.” Said Mike.
</p>
<p>“I like your dress.” Said Ze to Janet as she was getting into the Mazda.
</p>
<p>“Thank you.” Said Janet.
</p>
<p>Frank passed Janet the joint and she took a deep hit of it.
</p>
<p>“We just gonna be sitting in chilling somewhere beautiful aren’t we?” said Janet.
</p>
<p>“What do you mean by just?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I mean we just gonna be sitting somewhere?” said Janet.
</p>
<p>“We gonna get out and walk around.” Said Mike.
</p>
<p>“Alright Cool.” Said Janet.
</p>
<p>The four took to the road and headed down Winton to Winton Woods. It was a trip to get there. There was some mesmerizing that was going on from the weed and the world was trying to mention how it loves itself to itself and the air was clean of tobacco and the world was revolving around a car that was detailed like it ain have a wrapper to be found and the floor didn’t even have a piece of lint on it and there were two dresses and two slacks chilling on some green color and the smoke was like whiter than the clouds that were floating up above. The sun was like a champion that was letting the world know that it was cool to be playing under it’s light and like Winton Woods.
</p>

<p>How often you get to play in Winton Woods?
</p>
<p>“Mike.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Yeah.” Said Mike.
</p>
<p>“Stop at UDF I want to pick up some bread to feed the ducks with.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“We duck feedin’ now.” Said Mike.
</p>
<p>“Yeah I want to feed the ducks.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Pick up two loaves Ze. I’ll buy em.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“When was the last time we fed the ducks?” said Janet.
</p>
<p>“This weed has me thinking that this is what we are supposed to do in life, buncha stuff we ain do in a long time, like you’re supposed to do all the stuff then it’s about getting around to doing it all over again. Like little things like feeding the ducks. Ain done that in a minute.” Said Mike.
</p>
<p>“This that good weed. Good conversation comes from it.” Said Frank
</p>
<p>“I can take some photos.” Said Janet.
</p>
<p>“Cool.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>Like they were pulling up to Winton Woods and it looked empty like they had the park to themselves.
</p>
<p>Short story shorter Frank, Ze, Mike, and Janet rolled up to Winton Woods. They parked their car near the lake and they just lived a little bit. There was some smoke in the air as they passed around the next joint and the next joint and the next joint and the next joint and they took the bread and sprinkled it on the water and the ducks started quacking and it was like amazing to see some people get high and Frank was all nostalgic in Winton Woods.
</p>
<p>Everyone knew Frank was supposed to live in New York City but like there were some things that he would miss so he decided to stay. He wasn’t taking Ze from her home and he wasn’t missing out on some ducks in a lake in some park on the suburbs of town.
</p>
<p>Like they were two couples sitting on the hood of the car and the trunk and Frank and Ze were holding hands and Mike and Janet were making out and it was like the 50’s showed up and gave the 10’s something to think about. There have always been parks but it’s not driving past the parks that does any good it’s driving into the parks and spending green on some green to be around the green and like you can whisper your girl’s name in Winton Woods and she’ll hear you and like Date Night is Great Night waiting to happen and in my world I just remember the moments and like Ze never stopped being good to me. She just reminded me that we did things. We had lives. We crossed paths and she still holds my hand.
</p>
<p>There was that night at Winton Woods. Mike Drove. He had a buncha stuff to talk about and it was cool because like there was a hella bent life we could have been living and leading and we chose instead to kick it with our girls and smoke some doja and yeah we never invented anything and we never built that website but we got to feed the ducks and I still remember the color of the sun that afternoon because like there wasn’t anything to do so we built some stories and wrote some fiction and there were these girls walking around and we got to spend time with them from time to time and we were all trying to be play mates and we just wanted to have some fun before life came at us like a ton of bricks that it had before and before and before.
</p>
<p>Frank and Mike and Janet and Ze knew how much life weighed and sometimes the park and some ducks and a car and some time and it all didn’t feel like it weighed as much as it was supposed to because this was serious all of this but like when you out with Ze … you smile more often.
</p>
<p>The End
</p>
<p>Frank was sitting on the computer when Ze walked in. Ze was wearing her faceand she had on something shimmering.</p>

<p>“I want to go out.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Is that what you have been doing this entire time I have been appropriating meta tags for my WordPress posts?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Yes.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“You were getting ready to go out while I was doing my meta accounting?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Yes.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Alright.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I want to go to Schumer’s.” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“We met at Schumer’s.” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“I know that’s why I want to go with this dress on. It’s nicer than the one I wore the night we met.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“You want me to stop meta tagging web sites and actually tag you?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Tag Me!” said Ze.
</p>
<p>Frank got up and took Ze into his arms and then she had a thought.
</p>
<p>“OO OO My make up. We can’t.” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“How about this. How about you go to Schumer’s in messed up make up. It would be punk?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>“NO.” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I ain got it like I used to.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“You never had it like that. Maybe next time we’ll make out right before we go in. It would be a hot look.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Especially why it would be smeared.” Said Frank.
</p>
<p>“Especially.” Said Ze.
</p>

<h2> START</h2>

<p>Dick was involved in his own personal downward dog in the middle of his apartment. He knew he had too much stuff. Just too much. He knew he did. He knew it. He didn’t even want carpeting. He knew he wanted a wood floor. He knew he did. He knew it. He knew when it came to floor he wanted wood. He knew it. When it came to wood floors he knew he wanted wood. He was in the downward dog position and he was just at the point where he was transitioning to the upward dog position when she walked in.
</p>
<p>“Cha doin?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Yoga.” Said Dick.
</p>
<p>“K’s” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I can’t even do yoga when you are in the room even though I would love to be able to.” Said Dick.
</p>
<p>“Y Not?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I’m not at that level yet. I’m not at the level where I can do yoga in my apartment with someone else in the room. I’m not. I can do yoga in a room with an instructor but I’m not at the level of my yoga where when someone else is in the room I can keep doing yoga. I can do yoga by myself alone and that’s the only way I can really do yoga.” Said Dick.
</p>
<p>“You don’t have to do yoga.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“I know. Well I sort of have to. I know I don’t have to. Like I know. But I sort of do.” Said Dick.
</p>
<p>“I don’t do yoga.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Aaagh. I know. You don’t do a lot of stuff.” Said Dick.
</p>
<p>“Is there anything wrong with not doing a lot of stuff?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“No.” said Dick the opposite of sternly but just as confident. A very confident not stern statement of just that.
</p>
<p>“Can you get in trouble for doing a lot of stuff?” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Yeah. If I am being honest. If you do a lot of stuff you can get in trouble.” Said Dick.
</p>
<p>“I know. I know that a long time ago.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>“Well.” Said Dick.
</p>
<p>Ze shook her head a little bit from side to side and it looked like she had the first thought she had had in several times and she sort of bended her neck and her head moved from side to side and she rolled her head around some and she sort of looked to the side and then she looked at Dick and then she lowered her body and did a single push up.
</p>
<p>“If you did one of those a day. You would do 365 a year. That’s not a small number.” Said Ze.
</p>
<p>Dick’s eyes sort of reacted and that was all.
</p>
<p>END
</p>
<p>STARTING</p>

<p>Ze had her chiffon on. She was standing there looking in the mirror. She was just looking at herself. She was sort of noticing how she liked the color of the chiffon. It was the only dress she was ever given and she only wore it in front of the mirror. No one else knew that.
</p>
<p>Dick walked in and noticed her wearing the chiffon in front of the mirror and when she realized someone saw her wearing it. She habitually stopped looking in the mirror and started to pull her shoulder out of the dress and she started to disrobe. Dick sort of noticed her taking the dress off and he sort of pulled his head to the side and looked at her through the sides of his eyes.
</p>
<p>She looked over her shoulder at him.
</p>
<p>She wasn’t going to get naked but she knew he was going to see some skin.
</p>
<p>Dick sort of stood there and watched her.
</p>
<p>She knew she was trapped in that the closet she needed to get her clothing from was in the closet behind Dick and that she needed to ask him to move to get some clothing.
</p>
<p>She wasn’t happy today.
</p>
<p>Dick wasn’t happy either.
</p>
<p>She walked over to the closet with the chiffon folded over onto itself and her bra was exposed and she brushed Dick aside for a moment without touching him and she went through her closet and decided that out of the fourteen outfits she had that she was going to wear a pair of jeans and a t-shirt. She picked the most rock t-shirt that she could find and the jeans she treated as a project once with a knife. She knows exactly why she treats all of her jeans with a knife.
</p>
<p>Dick saw her going at a pair of jeans once with a knife and he didn’t want to know why. She just this one time she was all with knife and she was like the jeans bent her or something and she just went in on em.
</p>
<p>Dick saw her pull the jeans from the closet and she pulled her “1 Fuck Given and Only 1” T Shirt and she just knew she was going to go for a walk. She thought for a second that she felt a certain way when she went for a walk for no reason and cars were passing her on the side and she just it depended on what she was wearing but from time to time it occurred to her that she could at any time but to this day she is sort of proud she never did.
</p>
<p>Dick sort of didn’t know about that and he never asked her about most of what she was surprised no one ever asked her about and she really only talked about what she was asked about.
</p>
<p>END</p>
<p>
START</p>

<p>Dick went into the bathroom and picked up his tooth brush and picked up some toothpaste and he did this. He put the tooth paste on his finger and put his finger to his teeth and put some toothpaste on his teeth. He kept his brush clean and shook his shoulders and went. Different.
</p>
<p>Ze saw him do it.
</p>
<p>She had this moment.
</p>
<p>“Dick!” said Ze.
</p>
<p>“What?” said Dick knowing da fuck she was talking about.
</p>
<p>“The right way?!” said Ze with her head forward and lowered and to the side with a look on her face like you know god damned good and well how to brush your teeth.
</p>
<p>Dick looked at her and didn’t say anything and just put some toothpaste on his tooth brush.
