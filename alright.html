<h1>Alright I Will Tell My Story</h1>
<p>I'm 36 and I'm currently in a situation that I never planned. in 2000 I was studying in England and ended up being hospitalized for Drug Induced Paranoia and then came back to the states and found my folks took it up as a parenting technique when I would stay up for 36 hours at a time studying web design or reading online they would hospitalize me. I ended up being determined to have a permanent disability known as Bipolar Disorder Type 1 and I currently live in an apartment.
</p>
<p>I graduated from University of Cincinnati in 2010 with a degree in English Literature. I also spent a year with the Public Allies and lost over 150 pound in a year which was brought on by medications.
</p>
<p>God smote me.
</p>

<p>I have been smited by God.
</p>
<p>God legit smited me.
</p>
<p>I wouldn't say I am stupid. I will point out I was not diagnosed with being stupid and I have had case managers say that they don't really think there is anything wrong with me in say New York City where I would probably get along better and I'm not moving because I don't really care for NYC and have been there enough times to know things like that city sleeps just like mine does.
</p>
<p>I just last week wrote 15 literary agents and am working my way through a Writer's Market Guide to Literary agents because I have enough writing projects started and finished that I could use an agent to help me with my publishing career.
</p>
<p>I recently had a book of mine read by a colleague in london that thinks the ending needs changed so I am in the process of working on that.
</p>

<p>I live on social security and now live an author's life. I have a guaranteed check for life. I will never be homeless because of my quote unquote permanent condition. My student loans were forgiven and all that keeps me from having a job is applying which I did today and continually do on a almost bi weekly basis apply for work on Career Builder and today I applied at McDonalds.
</p>
<p>I note that the vast majority of the authors I looked up to and look up to have and had day jobs.
</p>
<p>I know some things. In high school I was the valedictorian of my class of 400 and now unless you really talked to me you wouldn't know how intelligent I was.
</p>
<p>The book my friend read had him ecstatic he loved what he read and just requests that the story become more real instead of copping out with a dream sequence at the end.
</p>
<p>I recently lost a good friend because she told me she attempted to kill herself and I told her to check herself into a hospital because she knows the drill with her PHD in psychiatry. She screamed at me and ended our friendship and I proceeded to let her husband know on facebook and I called her place of work and notified them as well and the magazine she was working on a BDSM project on. We are no longer friends and I'm left with more intelligence maybe about how people really feel about psychiatric hospitalization.
</p>
<p>I'm normal quite normal most of the time sitting and reading online or writing.
</p>
<p>I've quite been told I am the most intelligent client Talbert House has ever seen. It's quite possible I have been misdiagnosed and the fights I got into with my mother were seen as mental illness when I lived with them while I was studying.
</p>
<p>I don't know how hard it is to make it in literature because I have placed pieces of my writing online. I have placed works on Amazon. I have been published in Thought Catalog and Alt Ohio and the Cincinnati New Record at Uc.
</p>
<p>I would say I am more interesting than most people just because how often can someone claim God smited them.
</p>
<p>I have tried learning computer software engineering but I just can't be fucked to do it. I study HTML and CSS and I don't know why I need more than that. I think a lot of web design it kitsch and lacking leadership and I think my designs stand out because they are always based on something and never really relying on gimmicks. I think web design is simple. Display the Content in an Organized fashion. I think a lot of web designers showcase flash and wow and I THINK if people really thought about it when you are asking a web designer to do a website for you you are letting the web designer know that you are prepared to do a lot of content generation. Web design to me is sort of like hiring someone to be your boss for three months. Web design is nothing without content and I see a lot of web designers developing web sites without thought as to the content. I think there are web designers that itching to use their CSS3 and Javascript skills and for the clients I have had that is not even been necessary or been discussed as pertinent to the job.
</p>
<p>I do a lot. It's a nice life living with a permanent mental disability that does not impair judgement or intelligence. Not really sure why this is a permanent disability but I get a free paycheck and ostensibly a free apartment and it's not a bad life.
</p>
<p>I am seeking work and I would say I went through a major life change. I spent a little under 2 years in state and city hospitals for Bipolar Type 1 and I now get a regular injection of Invega Sustena and and am ordered by the courts to basically do whatever they tell me to do.
</p>
<p>I learned that in a way you're an enemy of the state if you have a mental illness. I'm not mentally ill outside of Hamilton County so when or rather IF I move i'll be quitting my medications or I might see a private psychiatrist to get some pills and avoid the injection.
</p>
<p>I'm in a complicated situation and i'm 36 and I used to cry out about how unfair this is.
</p>
<p>Now I just believe that God smites people.
</p>
<p>Still working on this , not the easiest story to write really. Lot of issues to work through but this is the story you want.
