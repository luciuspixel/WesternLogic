<h1>So Like</h1>

<p>So like have you ever imagined a little girl sucking your dick before like imagined it?</p>

<p>Yeah a couple times.</p>

<p>So you're a pedophile.</p>

<p>Bitch I ain no pedophile i imagined my grandmother sucking my dick too. I imagined the pizza delivery guy sucking my dick. That woman that sold me tickets to the show last night I imagined her sucking my dick. I imagined Dan Rather sucking my dick back when 60 Minutes was on. I imagine people sucking my dick. It just happens. Like most of the time I am imagining someone sucking my dick. I'm supposed to work in porn.</p>

<p>
You pedophile son of a bitch.
</p>

<p>
I'm like the oppositve of a pedophile. My mind works in mysterious ways. Ask me how many times I've had my dick sucked before?
</p>

<p>
How many times have you had your dick sucked?
</p>

<p>
Never. I have never had my dick sucked that's why my brain keeps trying to imagine it happeneing. It's seen porn and never had it's dick sucked so now because porn let my brain know you can get your dick sucked it wants everyone to suck it's dick.
</p>

<p>
You're blaming your brain when really it's your fault.
</p>
<p>
Nope it's my brain's fault. I'm imaginging you sucking my dick right now. I'm used to it. I don't even want my dick sucked. It's not a priority to me. I just imagine it. Repeatedly.
</p>
<p>
Alright well it's right around the corner, you'll love this glory hole.
</p>
<p>
Bout time I had my dick sucked.
