I'm definitely agnostic about climate change because I don't know shit about it and I fucking hate winter and mofo hope the climate get's warmer so that like if earth has a problem with winter , fucking kill that shit , like da fuck we need winter for, fuck that, like so i'm agnostic and biased in terms of how I feel about climate change like i don't know shit about it but by the sound of it i just want to make it worse and warm this planet up even more ... just so happens i don't have enough coal to make it happen ... like i can't get involved in warming up the weather and getting paid good money to produce fossil fuels and just that like if i had it my way based on my agnostic beliefs i would build a coal burning power station on antarctica just so that i could burn fossil fuels and not give a fuck about air pollution because there ain enough people in antarctica to care so i could build like 500 coal burning power plants in antarctica and just get to warming up this climate but like i'm agnostic so i don't even know if it would work and like i don't have any access to coal cept buford's charcoal briquettes and like i have a lot but like not enough to really do anything even though i do tend to burn charcoal briquettes a lot in my grill and i just always throw in some extra to try and bring more global warming like but being agnostic about global warming i don't even know if it really works and like i probably waste a lot of coal.

like i think bill nye a smart guy i just wish he would help us stamp out winter because fuck winter
like maybe to the shagrin to the environmental scientists like the wrong people get ahold of the science that al gore worked on like we take al gore's work and instead of balancing out the climate we trust that it's good science and use our knowledge from al gore to collectively stamp out winter and save russia
like what if there was like some hood as fuck planeteers that would help us figure this out like one guy raises his fist to the sky and is like WEED! someone else raises their fist to the sky and is like CRACK! someone else raises their fist to the sky and is like WHITE OWL! and someone else raises their fist to the sky and is like BASKETBALL! and someone else raises their fist to the sky and is like NIGGA! and like with our powers combined we call on captain planet and like they rub their planeteer pinky rings and like next thing you know a swoosh of energy flows through the air and like CORNEL WEST shows up in a tricked out cadillac and is like get to work bitches and they all start doing their thing or something i don't know somehow those people work to bring a safer climate change just the hood way .. or something just riffing here to save the plaent hood style
