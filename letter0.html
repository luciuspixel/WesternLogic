<h1><p>Dear Department of the Treasury,
</p></h1>
<p>What if the United States had a basic income? What if there was a rationale for a basic income? What about a nice one too with rent freezes and price freezes so that in a year's time the money would still be worth the money? I know something about wealth it's not necessarily who has the most money it's how much more money does someone have than someone else? As I understand it wealth is where someone has something that someone else does not and the had thing is important. That is wealth as I understand it. It's about someone making certainyou are more powerful than someone else because of what you have. It might not even have to do with cash it might have to do with education. 
</p>
<p>Back to basic income.
</p>
<p>In a world with basic income in the United States there are going to be people that take their basic income and quit. People are going to drop out if we do it in the United States like Finland is testing out. The labour pool would shrink ostensibly because the people that ONLY work because they have to survive would be able to live their dream and binge watch to their heart's content. It may even be surprising who takes that route. Now your employer's I would say they get an unforeseen bonus and an increase in profits. Reason being their labor force is going to shrink and the only people that are going to be working are going to be the people that WANT to work. There would be a class divide. We still need the food and the clothing and the cars and the buildings being built. We cannot stop working but we can evolve our system of welfare to a point where everything is voluntary.
</p>
<p>I would imagine life in the US becomes more austere in these conditions because the luxurious pointless businesses that survive on tools of trade alone such as let me look around my apartment for example and find something, let's say refrigerator magnets, they might lose their entire work force unless there were some people nostalgic about making refrigerator magnets, which are indubitably tools of trade. In the modern US economy we are looking at an abundance of tools of trade. Things people think of to manufacture and trade for other items that are more useful to them than their tool of trade. We might lose the tool of trade industry. We might.
</p>
<p>Getting a job would be exceptionally easy because the labor pool shrank and the dead weight can now live their dead weight lifestyles. The ambitious leaders of the United States would expect to see in a Basic Income Fortified United States an ability to fill out a form online and be placed with a job the next day. Quite an improvement.
</p>
<p>Not in the dead weight sector that is going to drink their money smoke their money save their money buy food with their money pay their rent with their money keep up on their phone bill with their money eat at a restaurant with their money buy shoes for their dead weight kids with their money money this kind of money is going to forever circulate. If the dead weight population knew it no longer had a need to save money and that it was guaranteed money and grants for car repairs and were enabled to participate in society and served the function of circulating money. They would be your audience at this point. They would be the people you would gear your advertising to because if every citizen was granted say in modern lingua franca $75,000 they could spend money every day of the year and christmas and birthdays anniversaries the dead weight society would be squared away. 
</p>
<p>The dead weight society have no dreams so it would be money in money out. The volunteers would make significantly more money and would have an easier results driven active work environment. You would lose dead weight from the labor force but you would gain a capable volunteer service that was paid $75,000 a year as basic income and on top of that they would earn their wages and these volunteers are the people that you want to have extra money business money because these are the people that are in their spare time going to run businesses themselves or take on their previous job as a client and run their own business.
</p>
<p>I get that multi media conglomerates and the 492 billionaires of this nation do not want to see 493 billionaires. It's a club. It's a nice club. It's a club everyone wants to get into. It's a powerful club. It's a wise club. It's a club that the volunteers aspire to be in. I think you can part the red seas with Basic Income. I think you can honorably honor the dead weight and respect their wishes to be dead weight and live at home and lead a luxurious lifestyle on a basic $75,000 income. So long as they know their job is to spend money. Reagonomics will be in a state where it trickles down from the government and the system in place takes the trickle down and it siphons it back up through the systems back into the government and banking and corporate America and we circulate our money.
</p>
<p>Basic Income might technically be trickle down but really it would be trickle up. The financial base of the US would be 300 000 000 citizens armed with $75,000 at a minimum and rent is froze and prices are froze and now the dead weight can get what they want and just be given money no longer wasting time at important offices they can spend money every day they can live their dead weight dreams and a real nimble labor force will arrive and keep our office culture on a yearly basis keeping up with the trends and advancements where in the bar it may be the year 2016 but in the office it could very well be the year 2036 based on the evolution of the office culture that would take place.
</p>
<p>You have less to train and can rely more on the intelligence of your university graduates and can be again more nimble and the dead weight can get what they want and the volunteers at that point can get the experiences in leadership and experience on the job they crave.
