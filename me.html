<h1>Buttscraping</h1>

<p>The story of a man that ends up on social security in an apartment and he spends all his money on weed but he’s addicted to cigarettes so he visits the two bars up the street and scrapes butts off people and discovers one bar won’t give him cigarettes and another bar will and then he throws up for the last time and decides to try Zonnic gum to take the edge off. 
</p>
<p>Engages in behavior like at 6am goes out and scrapes butts off the sidewalk just in time for the bakery to open.
</p>
<p>Notices the cops walk up and down the street every night and make certain the businesses are locked.
</p>
<p>Didn’t go to the church festival because he’s not too into jesus or gambling.
</p>
<p>Does’t go to the Christian church because he’s afraid he’ll get kicked out for having an English Literature degree.
</p>
<p>Has the internet and discovers that Amazon sells books for a penny and shipping and handling but you can buy a grip of books and the handling never changes.
</p>
<p>Then at the world’s longest yard sale he finds this woman come up to him ask him why all he is selling is books. He tells her these are just the ones he’s read even though he is lying and doesn’t want her to know he paid a penny for them and some shipping and handling. He asks for her phone number and she say’s maybe next time.
</p>
<p>See’s her on OKCupid and he says I thought you had a boyfriend.
</p>
<p>She doesn’t write back.
</p>
<p>Then one night at the bar he’s just sitting there smoking out the ash tray another golden one one that’s three quarter’s not smoked. And a brother walks up to him and after he asks for a cigarette and he say’s here’s twenty dollars go buy yourself a pack and he rolls it of a wad as big as a fist. Real alpha muffucka.
</p>
<p>Then he takes the twenty dollars and buys two packs of cigarettes and two lighters instead of saving up for that trip to san Francisco.
</p>
<p>Then he skypes his friend in London to ask if he should go stay in the nicest homeless shelter in America in San Francisco. He tells him the same thing his mother told him in regards to whether or not he should.
</p>
<p>HELL NO! 
</p>
<p>Not without no support system.
</p>
<p>So he starts doing sprints and he figures I guess I gotta make this work.
</p>
<p>Then he tells Brenda to forget about the job placement with Touchstone and IKRON.
</p>
<p>He decides instead to look that girl up one more time and ask her if after she bought a book she wasn’t going to talk to him.
</p>
<p>She write’s back and says if he can take her out to dinner she’ll go with him.
</p>
<p>He hasn’t smoked in a week. He’s been running the last week too. Lost 2 pounds. 
</p>
<p>Looks like he’s going to have to shave.
</p>
<p>Then he meets her and she stands him up. 
</p>
<p>Turn’s out she just wanted to take a photograph of him sitting in the booth alone.
</p>
<p>Turns out she’s bipolar type 2.
</p>
<p>He’s just bipolar type 1.
</p>
<p>So he waits so long.
</p>
<p>Order’s his meal.
</p>
<p>Then goes back to his apartment to work on his website.
</p>
<p>He’s published now.
</p>
<p>The whole world over.
