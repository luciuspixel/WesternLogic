<h1>
Critique
</h1>

<p>I'll tell you. People need to practice critiquing. I critiqued for 20 hours a week for 5 years and I still didn't maser it. Critiquing is an art. It's where you put something up on the wall and you deconstruct it for it's flaws and successes.
</p>
<p>It takes time effort and energy to become GOOD at critique and quite frankly you need to also know the person to critique them. I won several let's say casual awards for my critiquing style in DAAP at Uc.
</p>
<p>I have made people cry before in critique such as when I pointed out that shadows are not white to a fine arts student. She cried. She cried a lot. It was awful work.
</p>
<p>Knowing that critique is more about helping someone achieve their goal as opposed to extolling an opinion or virtue in critique. When someone tries to do something and you know what they are trying to do and you see areas where they succeeded in achieving their goal and you see areas where they failed at achieving their goal you point out both and the person can grow from the critique.
</p>
<p>The 99%th percentile of society has never critiqued as much as a designer. With design comes critique and it's about taking away as much as possible in design. In story telling it may be about tweaking the narrative curve of a story or quite frankly a denoument of r/Writing is that there is no goal stated other than to participate in writing.
</p>
<p>It is sort of a group of people that do not know each other, there is no wall to put the work up on and critique it in a group setting. This is sort of a poor environment for there to even be critiques occurring.
</p>
<p>Using writing to critique writing seems fairly weak and abstract. What you would want is sound to critique abstract works of writing. I think you want what I experienced for 5 years. I think you are frustrated you are not receiving design critiques on the work in writing.
</p>
<p>I mean in design school everyone in the 20 person class had a project brief and we spent 10 weeks working to solve the visual logic puzzle and to a large extent your grade was up to the professor and to a large extent your grade was up to your peers. There were rules it was like Top Gun like we were the best and brightest from around the nation and we went through stages of learning how to critique.
</p>
<p>Understand that people think they know something when they have never practiced it or thought about it.
</p>
<p>Right now you want abstract works of writing to be critiqued with abstract works of writing criticising the abstract works. There is no goal in mind. This is a very poor critique environment. If there are goals people want to achieve if people when they posted their work discussed what they were trying to achieve people could discuss with them whether they achieved it or not and then you could have critique.
</p>
<p>You do need to be working on fitting something into a best possible solution. Critiquing the shape of let's say a puddle of water or mud is pointless because it's just the way it is and that's why it's the way it is. There has to be logic and reasoning and people have to make choices for their to be critique otherwise it's just banter and ego stroking or jabbing.
</p>
<p>This isn't a good environment for critiquing. First of all there are no skype accounts listed. No one is identifying themselves. There are no group skype sessions or google hangouts being scheduled. Knowing who someone is is a big part of critique. This is basically just a place to come and bust a nut right now and blow a load. It's not a place for coherent critique.
</p>
<p>Reddit believe it or not with it's anonymous policy is robbing people of just want you want. Critique. People are not making friends. No one can understand someone's growth or brilliance or idiocy because Reddit is currently too abstract for that.
</p>
<p>If you are serious about critique and please understand I was a stand out pro at critique in DAAP. I was an award winning critique participant.
</p>
<p>I can tell you currently it's not possible to get what you want. You need goals that are to be achieved concrete goals. Critique is about letting someone know where they are achieving their goal and where they are not in the interest of getting them all the way into achievement of their goal.
</p>
<p>It's typically done in small classrooms with a professor or proctor or it's done in small studios for clients.
</p>
<p>Feelings do get hurt during critique but really only frail thin skinned people get upset. It's typically during a critique you listen to all of the critiques some 20 or 30 people in a school setting or 6 to 8 people in a professional studio setting and you during a critique sit back and listen to people extensively go over your work and discuss where they see you succeeding and where they see you failing in your stated objective.
</p>
<p>Truthfully this is a novel enough situation here and I won't get more involved than this unless I know skype accounts or google hangouts are going to be involved. It's rare that I give a fuck enough about something to type my response into Reddit to have it go into the litany of responses and just get ignored.
</p>
<p>I want to see people do something novel and mofo use some 20 year old software like skype for the first time and not act like we are doing something illicit. Basically for the most part i think SNOO is a fucking coward that is working to sell advertising while keeping several hundred thousand people from getting to know each other, build friendships, and promote their own work.
</p>
<p>I fucking hate reddit basically because of what you point out. It's shitty but it's only shitty because people don't know how to do something. Less than 1% of the world's population has experience in critique far less than 1% most people think it is about permeating an opinion when it's really about helping someone achieve a goal.
</p>
<p>There is logic to critique it's not really about opinions. You can actually get involved in a debate in critique and prove someone wrong. Like I remember defending my work in critique in design and then having someone prove my defense wrong and I ended up changing as a person and doing better work.
</p>
<p>You get a rock solid team of 25 people working on critiquing their work over 4 years. You'll have a family. I never saw anything bring people closer together than 3 hour critiques. A real critique of 25 people's work takes all day.
</p>
<p>You're getting a taste of something with these comments that I lived and breathed for 5 years and I know critique takes skill. You can fuck up in critique and get pwned but you learn the ins and outs. I was in Top Gun for Critique and really the reason our work was the calibre it was was because of the critiques. It became something and people started to legit care about their work and that's why we put in 80 hours a week because of the critiques.
</p>
<p>There was competition. Let's say the problem statement was to use three lines to make a composition. One line had to be thin another thick and another medium and they each had to be three different lengths and you had to fit them into a square and your craft had to be flawless.
</p>
<p>We studied critiquing abstract solutions to abstract problems and in the process we learned logic.
</p>
<p>There is logic in critique. There is not a lot of logic in the way r/Writing works so you have shit critiques.
</p>
<p>Mostly because none of you trained in critique.
</p>
<p>Like I did.
