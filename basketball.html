<h1>The Basketball Apps</h1>

<p>Javon was studying computer science at the University of Cincinnati. He had an idea for an app and he had a jump shot. It was just before basketball season and he was studyinng mercilessly a merciless topic. He was studying algorithms. He knew he was never going to invent his own sort but he was going to memorize the Quick Sort algorithm. He was a C computer science student but he kept a notebook of his own computer science goals that he was going to pursue after graduation. He kept a note of ideas. His crowning achievement he felt like was his app that made it easier to get into pick up basketball games. He sort of had a little dream with that. He was going to help people sign up for games and like he could monetize it with advertising. Something he could do after he graduated from University. He had a two quarters left. 
</p>
<p>
It was the late night and Javon was at a Fraternity Party the Sigma Alpha Sigma's. It was double cup double fist night. There's a reason he was a C student. Javon been to so many parties he sometimes get's nervous when someone ain do a keg stand by the end of the week. He loved University. He really ain even sweating that C because he tell himself his app going to get it done. He just learning the basics in school the rest of it up to him. Javon was at the party when this fine thing came up to him. This fine thing. This thing so fine you would think God used sand paper on her.
