<h1>Never Sleep</h1>
<p>I wonder if you have ever done it before stayed up for a couple days without sleeping but it's amazing. It's my favorite drug. I decided I was just going to keep sleeping. A lot of the people that take the drug to avoid sleep never stayed up for days anyways. They just not sleeping and normal. Now that I know the goal is to stay awake I can basically finally get some work done now that I have some people to work with at 8am on a Tuesday night.
</p>

<p>We went to the strip club and like Cindy was bouncing her tits all night. She ain never stop. We had some drinks and like it was cool it was like the sun was out all day but it was just pill poppin mofo's.
</p>

<p>We were staying awake now. They ain no I ain take the pill. I just slept in secret. Hella expensive pill. Worth millions to anyone that took it in productivity. I just know that I want to dream.
</p>

<p>Lot of things different about me. I dream every time I go to sleep so I ain taking the pill because I just so happen to want to dream. A lot of people never have dreams so they ain got nothing to lose.
</p>

<p>I like sleeping. I gotta bed for a reason. I get that it's harmless. They sell it as a remedy sort of like a pill that can bring you as close to immortal life as you will ever get. People been taking the pill for years now and some people got rid of their bedrooms.
</p>

<p>So where they fuck?
</p>

<p>Hotel's shutting down. People just driving all night. It's enough to make your wonder if anyone is really in charge. Are we evolving or just doin shit?
</p>

<p>Some people starting to behave differently. There just enough people that they don't really notice. People that sleep the few of us left notice the change. I ain got that much shit to talk about.
</p>

<p>I ain trying to join no tribe. People that just roll together for weeks. They trying to sell it now as a bonding agent in society like with ads like never be tired again and like gain a whole new week within your week.
</p>

<p>It's crazy. I think I'm like the only person left in my city that don't take it or at least that's how it feels. Bosses have employees working over time plus over time and like people working a lot more on it with bosses requiring employees to take it. I live on social security and have Bipolar Disorder my doctor legit told me it wouldn't be a good idea for me.
</p>

<p>The next doctor I had told me it would be. I listened to the first doctor because he been my doctor for 10 years. He just retired is all. This new guy. I don't really give a shit about him.
</p>

<p>It's like the biggest change I notice in people is that they ain doing much else. Bars staying open 24/7 and people just spending three days at the same bar spending their money they earned from their last 4 day's paychecks.
</p>

<p>I know this one guy that straight sold his house because of that pill. Like he just like I ain need a place to sleep and like sleeping was 1/3 of my life. I don't need want or desire that 1/3rd anymore. Strange shit. Like people deciding they just gonna take 8 hour walks. Even during cold spells in winter people be spending their time in bars like bars like new homes. People fucking in their cars. Like it's just a different world.
</p>

<p>Like how long does it take to travel to a new planet and start a new civilization? I saw our planet at least the US start a whole new society dedicated to not sleeping. I really don't think they thought this all out. I dream. I ain never going to stop dreaming. I just know a lot of people that did.
